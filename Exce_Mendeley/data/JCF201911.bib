abstract = {Xenophyophores, giant, fragile, agglutinated foraminifera (protists), are major constituents of the abyssal megafauna in the equatorial Pacific Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a region where seabed mining of polymetallic nodules may occur in the future. As part of a baseline study of benthic communities we made extensive collections of xenophyophores in two areas (UK-1 and OMS) licensed for exploration by the International Seabed Authority. Based on test morphology, we distinguished 36 morphospecies (34 new to science) among 130 specimens. Twenty of these morphospecies yielded 184 DNA sequences, a 14-fold increase in genetic data for xenophyophores that confirms their high diversity in the eastern CCZ. A further 15 morphospecies (8 new to science) were recognised in samples from two other areas (APEI-6 and Russian exploration license area) within or adjacent to the CCZ. This large number of species confirms that the CCZ is a focal area for xenophyophore diversity. More broadly, it represents an unprecedented increase in the known global diversity of xenophyophores and suggests that many species remain undiscovered in the World's oceans. Xenophyophores are often sessile on nodules in the CCZ, making these delicate organisms particularly vulnerable to mining impacts. They can also play a crucial role in deep-sea ecosystems, providing habitat structures for meiofaunal and macrofaunal organisms and enhancing the organic content of sediments surrounding their tests. The loss of xenophyophores due to seabed mining may therefore have wider implications for the recovery of benthic communities following major human disturbances on the abyssal seafloor.},

abstract = {Tropical coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and economically important ecosystems on earth. Nevertheless, we found dramatic changes in coral communities on the reef slopes of Cura{\c{c}}ao and Bonaire since 1973. Cover and abundance declined for virtually all coral species. The data show a shift from communities dominated by framework building species (e.g., Orbicella spp.) to communities consisting of small opportunistic, phenotypically plastic, species, including few remaining structural colonies. Madracis mirabilis, Porites astreoides, Diploria strigosa, and Agaricia lamarcki are at present modest winners in the coral assemblage, although overall cover declined also for these species. Increased frequency and intensity of events inducing coral mortality and ongoing reduction in suitable hard substratum, provided by the remnants of large colony building species, could reduce the chance of these species to remain winners in the longer run. The observed loss in coral cover and the shift from larger structural to smaller opportunistic species reduced reef carbonate production by 67{\%} and therewith, in combination with a trend toward smaller coral colonies, reef complexity. Alarmingly, reefs at upper-mesophotic depths (30-40 m) did not escape the general degradation of the coral community. The negative effects are larger around densely populated areas where local stressors are adding to degradation caused, for instance, by region wide mass bleaching. Without proper conservation and management this already dramatic degradation will continue and turn more and more coral species into losers.},

abstract = {The new record of a shallow-water submarine hydrothermal field ({\textless}150 m w.d.) in the western Mediterranean Sea (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) allows us to study CO 2 fluid impact on benthic foraminifers. Benthic foraminifers calcification process is sensitive to ocean acidification and to local chemical and physical parameters of seawater and pore water. Thus, foraminifers can record specific environmental conditions related to hydrothermal fluids, but at present their response to such activity is poorly defined. The major outcome of this study is the finding of a very uncommon taxon for the Mediterranean Sea, i.e., the Spiculosiphon oceana, a giant foraminifer agglutinating spicules of sponges. This evidence, along with the strong decrease of calcareous tests in the foraminiferal assemblages associated to hydrothermal activity, provides new insights on the meiofauna living in natural stressed environment. In particular, observations obtained from this study allow us to consider S. oceana a potential tolerant species of high CO 2 concentrations (about 2–4 times higher than the normal marine values) and a proxy of acidic environments as well as of recent ocean acidification processes.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of determining the structure of clustered data, without prior knowledge of the number of clusters or any other information about their composition. Data are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different cluster. Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian components with different parametrizations and cross-cluster constraints. Noise and outliers can be modelled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the EM result provides a measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point. Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or of varying sizes and shapes.},

abstract = {This paper presents experimental results using a newly developed 3D underwater laser scanner mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The algorithm consists of registering point clouds using a dual step procedure. First, a feature-based coarse alignment is performed, which is then refined using iterative closest point. The robot position is estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that fuses the data coming from navigation sensors of the AUV. Moreover, the pose from where each point cloud was collected is also stored in the pose-based EKF-SLAM state vector. The results of the registration algorithm are used as constraint observations among the different poses within the state vector, solving the full-SLAM problem. The method is demonstrated using the Girona 500 AUV, equipped with a laser scanner and inspecting a 3D sub-sea infrastructure inside a water tank. Our results prove that it is possible to limit the navigation drift and deliver a consistent high-accuracy 3D map of the inspected object.},

abstract = {Approximately three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by water in the form of lakes, rivers, seas or oceans. The surface area covered by water on the Earth is ten times larger than the surface area of the Moon (Ross, 2006). While mankind is actively pursuing explorations of the Moon and outer space, in its backyard around 95{\%} of the world's oceans and 99{\%} of the ocean floor still remain unexplored (Mohseni, 2006). The quest for understanding what lies below the water bodies has motivated the development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). AUVs are robotic mobile instrument carriers that have self-contained propulsion, sensors and intelligence, allowing them to successfully complete sampling and survey tasks with little or no human intervention (Chryssostomidis and Schmidt, 2006). One of the early attempts was the development of 'Special Purpose Underwater Research Vehicle', or SPURV to study diffusion, acous-tic transmission, and submarine wakes. With significant develop-ments in artificial intelligence, control theory, and computer hardware, totally autonomous underwater vehicles have become a reality (Chryssostomidis and Schmidt, 2006). Being untethered and independent, AUVs provide a platform for ocean exploration and fill in the gap left by existing manned submersibles and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) (Shah, 2007). Over the last few decades, ocean research and exploration have gained a lot of momentum driven by the advances in research, development and successful commercial implementation of AUV technologies. As part of the current research, a survey was done based on a search made on Scopus that covers nearly 18,000 titles from more than 5000 international publishers, including coverage of 16,500 peer-reviewed journals in the scientific, technical, medical and social sciences field, with the keywords AUV or Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. From the survey, 5393 most relevant articles that were published before June 2013 have been used to conduct a research trend analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the AUV research trend shows a steep climb in the number of published articles indicating increased research emphasis in recent years. AUVs provide a new marine platform that has proven to be an asset in many areas of oceanographic research and exploration. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in AUV research among several communities. These include the use of deep water AUVs to map bathymetry around oil wells, surveillance or mine information gathering by the navies, and a host of scientific and engineering communities for data collection (Desa et al., 2006), oceanographic measurements in adverse weather (Shome et al., 2008). The wide range of applications has resulted in development of AUVs with a variety of shapes, sizes, working depth limits, sources of energy and means of propulsion. The specifics of the mission determine these features (Chyba, 2009). Fig. 2 shows a classifica-tion of AUVs that are currently being used. A global search on a number of AUV research and development projects indicates around 155 unique configurations in different stages of use and development (AUVAC, 2012). An extensive classification of these AUVs is presented in Fig. 3. Based on the above survey, the following observations can be made: AUV technology has evolved from concept demonstrators to commercial products (Vestgard et al., 2001) and they are routinely being used for military and civilian applications (Woolsey and Techy, 2009). Despite significant progress, AUV design still poses significant challenges due to its varied nature of applications (Jun et al., 2009). AUVs appear in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The shape and the size of an AUV dictate its performance such as Contents lists available at ScienceDirect},

However detailed seafloor observations such as microscopic analysis of sand grain structure or study of microbial colonies require a platform with stable footing on the seafloor, which cannot be provided by a cruising type AUV. In this research the authors propose a new class of AUV, capable of landing to provide a stable, but mobile, platform with which to perform these observations. This paper proposes a sensing system and a software algorithm to enable the AUVs to perform landing. A light sectioning based method is used to scan the seafloor with high resolution. Since the seafloor can change abruptly and at short intervals, the reliability and functioning of such technology requires real-time seafloor classification and detection of suitable landing sites. A landing algorithm has been developed which uses three dimensional bathymetry data and calculates a landing vector coordinate in real-time. A microscope sensor payload developed to obtain magnified images of the seafloor after landing has also been tested. Data from sea experiments are presented, where the algorithm demonstrated real-time generation of landing vector coordinates for an ROV.},

abstract = {Study of seafloor mineral deposits, such as ferro-manganese crusts and hydrothermal vents is an important topic for seafloor exploration and economic development. However such deposits are often dispersed over vast areas and in order to understand them better, high resolution data needs to be obtained. Underwater systems are typically not capable of performing such wide area surveys while obtaining high resolution data at the same time, and often multiple deployments of different types of vehicles are necessary. In order to achieve more efficient surveys, this work proposes a multi-resolution survey strategy. The strategy involves superimposing high-resolution visual observations of the seafloor, including microscopic imagery of the seafloor, obtained at discrete intervals within a lower resolution, wide area acoustic map of the region taken during a single AUV dive. By utilizing such a strategy, data of various resolutions can be obtained to generate a multi-layered map of a wide area of the seafloor. A three stage strategy has been proposed for an underwater autonomous mobile platform to perform such a survey. First, the AUV cruises between points at high speed while measuring acoustic bathymetry. At intermediate points along its track, the AUV measures higher resolution data using a sheet laser system, while searching for suitable landing sites within the laser scanned area, to land. Once landed, the vehicle remains stationary and performs further higher resolution observations of the seafloor. We are currently developing such a platform, or ‘Bottom Skimmer', to perform high-resolution visual, acoustic and chemical analysis of the seafloor from low altitudes.},

abstract = {Fine-scale structural complexity created by reef-building coral in shallow-water environments is influential on biodiversity, species assemblage and functional trait expression. Cold-water coral reefs are also hotspots of biodiversity, often attributed to the hard surface and structural complexity provided by the coral. However, that complexity has seldom been quantified on a centimetric scale in cold-water coral reefs, unlike their shallow-water counterparts, and has therefore never been linked in a similar way to the reef inhabitant community. Structure from motion techniques which create high-resolution 3D models of habitats from sequences of photographs is being increasingly utilised, in tandem with 3D spatial analysis to create useful 3D metrics, such as rugosity. Here, we demonstrate the use of ROV video transect data for 3D reconstructions of cold-water coral reefs at depths of nearly 1000 m in the Explorer Canyon, a tributary of Whittard Canyon, NE Atlantic. We constructed 40 3D models of approximately 25-m-length video transects using Agisoft Photoscan software, resulting in sub-centimetre resolution reconstructions. Digital elevation models were utilised to derive rugosity metrics, and orthomosaics were used for coral coverage assessment. We found rugosity values comparable to shallow-water tropical coral reef rugosity. Reef and nearby non-reef communities differed in assemblage composition, which was driven by depth and rugosity. Species richness, epifauna abundance and fish abundance increased with structural complexity, being attributed to an increase in niches, food, shelter and alteration of physical water movement. Biodiversity plateaued at higher rugosity, illustrating the establishment of a specific reef community supported by more than 30{\%} coral cover. The proportion of dead coral to live coral had limited influence on the community structure; instead, within-reef patterns were explained by depth and rugosity, though our results were confounded to a certain extent by multi-collinearity. Fine-scale structural complexity appeared to be integral to local-scale ecological patterns in cold-water coral reef communities.},

abstract = {Reliable obstacle detection and classification in rough and unstructured terrain such as agricultural fields or orchards remains a challenging problem. These environments involve large variations in both geometry and appearance, challenging perception systems that rely on only a single sensor modality. Geometrically, tall grass, fallen leaves, or terrain roughness can mistakenly be perceived as nontraversable or might even obscure actual obstacles. Likewise, traversable grass or dirt roads and obstacles such as trees and bushes might be visually ambiguous. In this paper, we combine appearance- and geometry-based detection methods by probabilistically fusing lidar and camera sensing with semantic segmentation using a conditional random field. We apply a state-of-the-art multimodal fusion algorithm from the scene analysis domain and adjust it for obstacle detection in agriculture with moving ground vehicles. This involves explicitly handling sparse point cloud data and exploiting both spatial, temporal, and multimodal links between corresponding 2D and 3D regions. The proposed method was evaluated on a diverse data set, comprising a dairy paddock and different orchards gathered with a perception research robot in Australia. Results showed that for a two-class classification problem (ground and nonground), only the camera leveraged from information provided by the other modality with an increase in the mean classification score of 0.5{\%}. However, as more classes were introduced (ground, sky, vegetation, and object), both modalities complemented each other with improvements of 1.4{\%} in 2D and 7.9{\%} in 3D. Finally, introducing temporal links between successive frames resulted in improvements of 0.2{\%} in 2D and 1.5{\%} in 3D.},

abstract = {Underwater vehicles are currently being extensively used for observation and study of the seafloor. Detailed seafloor analysis requires wide area observations with high resolution information obtained from in-situ analysis from sensors or by sampling. Certain sensors require high altitude and high scanning where as others need proximity to the seafloor or contact with stable footing to perform integrated measurements over a period of time. Such wide area high resolution surveys cannot be performed by a single cruising or hovering type vehicle and often requires multiple deployments of different types of vehicles. In this research the authors have designed and developed a new class of AUV along with an intelligent survey technique in which an underwater vehicle can generate centimeter order wide area maps of the seafloor by cruising at high speeds using an acoustic sensor. At intermediate locations of interest identified by processing the acoustic data autonomously during the mission, higher order resolution information can be obtained by lowering scanning speed and altitude using a laser profiling system. The vehicle can also land at some of these locations to obtain integrated measurements at the same position or magnified images. A slightly negatively buoyant underwater vehicle has been designed and developed with systems necessary to perform such a survey. An algorithm to detect areas of interest from acoustic scanned bathymetry has been implemented and tested. An autonomous landing system has been developed which uses laser scanned bathymetry to calculate a landing vector coordinate for safe landing on the seafloor. Experiments were conducted at a tank facility to demonstrate the multi-resolution survey scheme. An artificially generated seafloor scenario was acoustically scanned from a high altitude and speed to identify an area of interest in real-time. This area was then scanned at an higher resolution by lowering altitude and speed to perform autonomous land- ng by detecting suitable landing sites using the landing algorithm. The results from these experiments have been included in the paper.},

This was achieved by combining Gaussian process (GP) modeling with onboard robotic autonomy, allowing volumetric measurements to be made at fine scales. Special focus was given to the patchiness of phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll a (Chla), an important factor for understanding biogeochemical processes, such as primary productivity, in the coastal ocean. During multiple field tests in Runde, Norway, the method was successfully used to identify, map, and track the subsurface chlorophyll a maxima (SCM). Results show that the algorithm was able to estimate the SCM volumetrically, enabling the AUV to track the maximum concentration depth within the volume. These data were subsequently verified and supplemented with remote sensing, time series from a buoy and ship-based measurements from a fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRf), particle imaging systems, as well as discrete water samples, covering both the large and small scales of the microbial community shaped by coastal dynamics. By bringing together diverse methods from statistics, autonomous control, imaging, and oceanography, the work offers an interdisciplinary perspective in robotic observation of our changing oceans.},

abstract = {The number of marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased dramatically in the last decade and poses a major logistic challenge for conservation practitioners in terms of spatial extent and the multiplicity of habitats and biotopes that now require assessment. Photographic assessment by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) enables the consistent description of multiple habitats, in our case including mosaics of rock and sediment. As a case study, we used this method to survey the Greater Haig Fras marine conservation zone (Celtic Sea, northeast Atlantic). We distinguished 7 biotopes, detected statistically significant variations in standing stocks, species density, species diversity, and faunal composition, and identified significant indicator species for each habitat. Our results demonstrate that AUV-based photography can produce robust data for ecological research and practical marine conservation. Standardizing to a minimum number of individuals per sampling unit, rather than to a fixed seafloor area, may be a valuable means of defining an ecologically appropriate sampling unit. Although composite sampling represents a change in standard practice, other users should consider the potential benefits of this approach in conservation studies. It is broadly applicable in the marine environment and has been successfully implemented in deep-sea conservation and environmental impact studies. Without a cost-effective method, applicable across habitats, it will be difficult to further a coherent classification of biotopes or to routinely assess their conservation status in the rapidly expanding global extent of MPAs.},

abstract = {Species morpho-functional traits provide general and predictable rules to understand the dynamics of ecological communities; therefore, considering species identity is crucial in understanding ecosystem functioning. Here, we propose a framework to estimate the species-specific functional contribution of Caribbean corals according to their capacity to create complex three-dimensional structures by means of calcium carbonate precipitation and their morphological complexity. We use a combination of field data and bibliographic information to integrate a Reef Functional Index (RFI) that considers the calcification rate, structural complexity and abundance (cover) of each coral species. As an example application of this tool, we evaluated various sites along the Mesoamerican Reef showing that the RFI can be used to compare reef sites or communities. The construction capacities of Caribbean coral species are highly variable, thus, different species configurations of a coral community result in a high level of functional variation. Most coral assemblages on the Mesoamerican Reef show non-framework species dominance (e.g. Undaria spp. and Porites astreoides), compromising reef functioning. However, sites with key reef-building species present showed considerably greater functioning despite those species not being dominant. The functional approximation for coral species proposed can be used by future studies considering changes in coral community composition, keystone species loss or to estimate reef function loss due to climate change or other stressors.},

abstract = {Digital imaging has become one of the most important techniques in environmental monitoring and exploration. In the case of the marine environment, mobile platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are now equipped with high-resolution cameras to capture huge collections of images from the seabed. However, the timely evaluation of all these images presents a bottleneck problem as tens of thousands or more images can be collected during a single dive. This makes computational support for marine image analysis essential. Computer-aided analysis of environmental images (and marine images in particular) with machine learning algorithms is promising, but challenging and different to other imaging domains because training data and class labels cannot be collected as efficiently and comprehensively as in other areas. In this paper, we present Machine learning Assisted Image Annotation (MAIA), a new image annotation method for environmental monitoring and exploration that overcomes the obstacle of missing training data. The method uses a combination of autoencoder networks and Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), which allows human observers to annotate large image collections much faster than before. We evaluated the method with three marine image datasets featuring different types of background, imaging equipment and object classes. Using MAIA, we were able to annotate objects of interest with an average recall of 84.1{\%} more than twice as fast as compared to "traditional" annotation methods, which are purely based on software-supported direct visual inspection and manual annotation. The speed gain increases proportionally with the size of a dataset. The MAIA approach represents a substantial improvement on the path to greater efficiency in the annotation of large benthic image collections.},

abstract = {The autonomous underwater vehicle has proven to be an important tool for study of the seafloor. Detailed seafloor analysis often requires wide area observations with high resolution information. Certain sensors require close proximity to the seafloor or contact, with stable footing to perform integrated measurements over a period of time. Such wide area high resolution surveys cannot be performed by a cruising or hovering type vehicle alone. In this research the authors propose a new class of AUV along with a survey technique in which an underwater vehicle can generate meter order resolution wide area maps of the seafloor, but at intermediate locations, obtain higher, centimeter order resolution information by lowering scanning speed and altitude and finally, by landing to obtain micrometer order resolution measurements or to perform integrated measurements at the same position. A new underwater vehicle with slight negative buoyancy has been developed which has hardware and software to perform landing on the seafloor. Since the seafloor can change abruptly and at short intervals, the reliability and functioning of such technology requires real-time seafloor classification for detection of suitable landing sites. A landing algorithm has been developed which uses laser profile data to calculate a landing vector coordinate for safe landing in realtime and this has been implemented on a newly developed landing vehicle. An autonomous landing system has been developed which uses this algorithm to perform landing operations. Experiments were conducted at a tank facility to demonstrate real-time computation of the landing algorithm and autonomous landing of the vehicle using the proposed system. Results from the landing experiments conducted are presented in this paper.},

The photomosaic was generated from digital photographs acquired using the ARGO II seafloor imaging system during the 1996 LUSTRE cruise, which surveyed a ̃1 km2 zone and provided a coverage of ̃20{\%} of the seafloor. The photomosaic has a pixel resolution of 15 mm and encloses the areas with known active hydrothermal venting. The final mosaic is generated after an optimization that includes the automatic detection of the same benthic features across different images (feature-matching), followedby a global alignment of images based on the vehicle navigation. We also provide software to construct mosaics from large sets of images for which georeferencing information exists (location, attitude, and altitude per image), to visualize them, and to extract data. Georeferencing information can be provided by the raw navigation data (collected during the survey) or result from the optimization obtained from image matching. Mosaics based solely on navigation can be readily generated by any user but the optimization and global alignment of the mosaic requires a case-by-case approach for which no universally software is available.

Efficient sampling of coastal ocean processes, especially mechanisms such as upwelling and internal waves and their influence on primary production, is critical for understanding our changing oceans. Coupling robotic sampling with ocean models provides an effective approach to adaptively sample such features. We present methods that capitalize on information from ocean models and in situ measurements, using Gaussian process modeling and objective functions, allowing sampling efforts to be concentrated to regions with high scientific interest. We demonstrate how to combine and correlate marine data from autonomous underwater vehicles, model forecasts, remote sensing satellite, buoy, and ship-based measurements, as a means to cross-validate and improve ocean model accuracy, in addition to resolving upper water-column interactions. Our work is focused on the west coast of Mid-Norway where significant influx of Atlantic Water produces a rich and complex physical-biological coupling, which is hard to measure and characterize due to the harsh environmental conditions.

The guidance law is a polynomial function with respect to time, and the desired vertical position, velocity and acceleration of UUV are determined. In particular, the necessary and sufficient condition for rationality of the guidance law is explained and proved. Theoretical analysis indicates that, with this method, the energy consumption of UUV only depends on the initial velocity and the final velocity, and thus a trade-off between time consumption and energy consumption could be achieved when setting desired velocities. Simulation results show that the UUV moves towards the destination at the determined velocity and acceleration by the proposed guidance law without overshoot, and the acceleration approaches zero according with the concept of soft landing. Safety, rationality, and effectiveness of the proposed guidance law are demonstrated.},

Recent technology of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) enables us to quickly survey a wide area in underwater environment with high resolution. We have developed an underwater gravity measurement system for exploration of seafloor deposits using an AUV. Our system consists of an underwater gravimeter and an underwater gravity gradiometer. A model calculation shows that the resolution of approximately 0.1 mgal for gravity and 10 E{\"{o}}tv{\"{o}}s (E) for gradient is required to detect a typical seafloor deposit. For the gravimeter system, we adopted an improved sea/air gravimeter and the sensor is mounted on a gimbal mechanism to keep vertical. A pressure capsule for the gravimeter has a diameter of 50 cm. The gradiometer comprises two identical gravimeters with a vertical separation of 44 cm. We developed the two gravimeters for the gradiometer. Both gravimeters are contained in a vacuum capsule and a gimbal system is also used to keep them vertical. We chose the AUV Urashima (JAMSTEC) to install both of the gravimeter and gradiometer. All the power is supplied from the Urashima and acoustic communication system on the Urashima enables real-time monitoring during sea experiments. So far, we have carried out four sea experiments in Sagami Bay, Izena Caldera in the middle Okinawa Trough, and Bayonnaise and Myojin knolls in the Izu-Ogasawara Arc. The Urashima was navigated at a constant speed and a constant depth or height above the seabottom. We successfully collected the data from both gravimeter and gradiometer with good quality in all experiments. We succeeded in obtaining good quality gravity anomaly data through processing of gravity data, water pressure data and AUV's navigation data including pitch and roll motion. It was found that our gravimeter system can attain an accuracy of 0.1 mGal at least in a good survey condition.},

The main goal of this paper is to develop a quick method to optimize the design of hydraulic support landing platform for the new UUV. In this paper, the geometry configuration and instability type of the platform are defined. Computational investigations are carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of the landing platform using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. Then, the response surface model of the optimization objective is established. The intelligent particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to finding the optimal solution. The result demonstrates that the stability of landing platform is significantly improved with the global objective index increasing from 1.045 to 1.158 (10.86{\%} higher) after the optimization process.},

abstract = {Motion performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is critical to the security and survey accuracy of AUVs. However, relationships among indices used to evaluate the motion performance are generally complicated and cannot be formulated mathematically, and it is hard to clarify how each index affects the motion performance of AUVs. In this paper, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method was proposed to assess motion performance of AUVs. Focused on the landing AUV, process of the FCE method was described in detail, and the FCE system was constructed. In the FCE system, a three-level evaluating index system was built according to the motion characteristics of the landing AUV. Based on analysis of the survey process and measurement requirements of the landing AUV, the weight sets of each factor set were determined by applying the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. The single-factor evaluation matrix was obtained by solving the membership function with ridged-shape distribution. Decision-making was completed through comparing evaluation results of the motion performance of two layout schemes. Field trials showed that the evaluation results could reflect the motion performance of landing AUVs objectively and comprehensively. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This thesis examines the design of supervisory controllers for windfarms of pitch controlled wind turbines The control objectives are the maximisation of the nancial income from the generated electricity and the minimisation of the turbines fatigue damage The design exploits the wide variations in the ratio of nancial income to fatigue damage which are found both spatially across windfarms and as a function of time The supervisory control strategy makes use of the ability of pitch controlled turbines to operate with variable power set points a capability which is rarely exploited in practice. A windfarm simulation which has been developed for the purposes of testing super visory controllers is described It is shown that the simulation is a suitable testbed for this application Results are presented which demonstrate how the fatigue dam age of a turbine s gearbox and structural components vary as functions of the mean windspeed turbulence intensity and power set point both for isolated turbines and for turbines experiencing wake e ects. A lifetime performance function is proposed and ideal power set point curves are evaluated using a genetic search algorithm It is shown that signi cant improve ments in performance can be achieved if the operation of the turbines is altered to take account of variable electricity tarifs. A windfarm control strategy that splits the turbines into interacting and non interacting categories is found to give good results Using data generated by the sim ulation it is shown that simple cost functions can be developed for noninteracting turbines which when used in a controller give performance that is close to the ideal A similar cost function is applied to a group of three interacting turbines and it is found that substantial reductions in all measures of total annual fatigue damage are achieved for a small reduction in total annual nancial income The online implementation of windfarm supervisory controllers is discussed and the be haviour of a simple hillclimbing algorithm is examined using a simulated group of three interacting turbines},

The presence of the water and camera pressure housing in front of the camera act as additional optical elements. Spherical dome ports are difficult to manufacture and consequently expensive but at the same time they are the most useful for underwater photogrammetry as they keep the main geometric characteristics of the lens unchanged. Nevertheless, the manufacturing and alignment of dome port pressure housing components can be the source of unexpected changes of radial and decentring distortion, source of systematic errors that can influence the final 3D measurements. The paper provides a brief introduction of underwater optical phenomena involved in underwater photography, then presents the main differences between flat and dome ports to finally discuss the effect of manufacturing on 3D measurements in two case studies.},

Moreover, underwater equpment thatallows the use of digital cameras normally designed to work in air also in water are largely available. However, for assuring accurate and reliable 3D modelling results a profound knowledge of the employed devices as wel as physical and geometric principle is even more crucial than in air. This study aims to take a step forward in understanding the effect of underwater ports in front of the photographic lens. In particular, the effect of dome or flat ports on image quality in 3D modelling applications is investigated. Experiments conducted in a semi submerged industrial structure show that the tested flat port performs worse than the dome, providing higher image residuals and lower precision and accuracy in object space. A significant different quality per colour channel is also observed and its influence on achievable processing results is discussed.},

abstract = {Cold-water coral carbonate mounds, created by framework-building scleractinian corals, are also important habitats for non-scleractinian corals, whose ecology and role are understudied in deep-sea environments. This paper describes the diversity, ecology and role of non-scleractinian corals on scleractinian cold-water coral carbonate mounds in the Logachev Mound Province, Rockall Bank, NE Atlantic. In total ten non-scleractinian species were identified, which were mapped out along eight ROV video transects. Eight species were identified as black corals (three belonging to the family Schizopathidae, one each to the Leiopathidae, Cladopathidae, and Antipathidae and two to an unknown family) and two as gorgonians (Isididae and Plexauridae). The most abundant species were Leiopathes sp. and Parantipathes sp. 2. Areas with a high diversity of non-scleractinian corals are interpreted to offer sufficient food, weak inter-species competition and the presence of heterogeneous and hard settlement substrates. A difference in the density and occurrence of small vs. large colonies of Leiopathes sp. was also observed, which is likely related to a difference in the stability of the substrate they choose for settlement. Non-scleractinian corals, especially black corals, are an important habitat for crabs, crinoids, and shrimps in the Logachev Mound Province. The carrier crab Paromola sp. was observed carrying the plexaurid Paramuricea sp. and a black coral species belonging to the genus Parantipathes, a behavior believed to provide the crab with camouflage or potentially a defense mechanism against predators. More information on the ecophysiology of non-scleractinian corals and fine-scale local organic matter supply are needed to understand what drives differences in their spatial distribution and community structure.},

abstract = {Increasingly, autonomous agents will be required to operate on long-term missions. This will create a demand for general intelligence because feedback from a human operator may be sparse and delayed, and because not all behaviours can be prescribed. Deep neural networks and reinforcement learning methods can be applied in such environments but their fixed updating routines imply an inductive bias in learning spatio-temporal patterns, meaning some environments will be unsolvable. To address this problem, this paper proposes active adaptive perception, the ability of an architecture to learn when and how to modify and selectively utilise its perception module. To achieve this, a generic architecture based on a self-modifying policy (SMP) is proposed, and implemented using Incremental Self-improvement with the Success Story Algorithm. The architecture contrasts to deep reinforcement learning systems which follow fixed training strategies and earlier SMP studies which for perception relied either entirely on the working memory or on untrainable active perception instructions. One computationally cheap and one more expensive implementation are presented and compared to DRQN, an off-policy deep reinforcement learner using experience replay and Incremental Self-improvement, an SMP, on various non-episodic partially observable mazes. The results show that the simple instruction set leads to emergent strategies to avoid detracting corridors and rooms, and that the expensive implementation allows selectively ignoring perception where it is inaccurate.},

abstract = {Abstract: Terrain ruggedness is often an important variable in wildlife habitat models. Most methods used to quantify ruggedness are indices derived from measures of slope and, as a result, are strongly correlated with slope. Using a Geographic Information System, we developed a vector ruggedness measure (VRM) of terrain based on a geomorphological method for measuring vector dispersion that is less correlated with slope. We examined the relationship of VRM to slope and to 2 commonly used indices of ruggedness in 3 physiographically different mountain ranges within the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. We used VRM, slope, distance to water, and springtime bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) adult female locations to model sheep habitat in the 3 ranges. Using logistic regression, we determined that the importance of ruggedness in habitat selection remained consistent across mountain ranges, whereas the relative importance of slope varied according to the characteristic physiography of each range. Our results indicate that the VRM quantifies local variation in terrain more independently of slope than other methods tested, and that VRM and slope distinguish 2 different components of bighorn sheep habitat.},

Urchin mortality of 100{\%} was observed at pHw 6.16 after 7 days and coincided with a pronounced hypercapnia in the coelomic fluid producing an irrecoverable acidosis. Coelomic fluid acid-base measures showed that an accumulation of CO2 and a significant reduction in pH occurred in all treatments compared with controls. Bicarbonate buffering was employed in each case, reducing the resultant acidosis, but compensation was incomplete even under moderate environmental hypercapnia. Significant test dissolution was inferred from observable increases in the Mg2+ concentration of the coelomic fluid under all pH treatments. We show that a chronic reduction of surface water pH to below 7.5 would be severely detrimental to the acid-base balance of this predominantly intertidal species; despite its ability to tolerate fluctuations in pCO2 and pH in the rock pool environment. The absence of respiratory pigment (or any substantial protein in the coelomic fluid), a poor capacity for ionic regulation and dependency on a magnesium calcite test, make echinoids particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic acidification. Geological sequestration leaks may result in dramatic localised pH reductions, e.g. pH 5.8. P. miliaris is intolerant of pH 6.16 seawater and significant mortality is seen at pH 6.63. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Studies on coral communities are scarce and old (1970s), due to its location 650km northeast of La Guaira Port and because it has military facilities. To upgrade baseline information we estimated size structure, percent live cover, species composition and abundance of corals and octocorals. We evaluated 16 sites around the island using the AGRRA Protocol (band-transects 10 m2) between 1.5 and 21m depth (n=67 transects), and visual surveys conducted in other five sites. We recorded 2 327 colonies belonging to four hydroid species and 36 species of stony corals in 11 families. The values for diversity, dominance and evenness of the coral community ranged between 0.78 and 2.12 (SW), 0.15 and 0.61 and 0.57 y 0.92 respectively. Most coral species had relative abundance values under 3{\%}, except Porites astreoides (25.57{\%}), Pseudodiploria strigosa (18.22{\%}) and Siderastrea siderea (14.44{\%}). They were represented mostly by smaller colonies, between 3 and 30cm in maximum diameter and between 0 and 5cm high. A total of 13 octocoral species belonging to three families were identified. Pseudopterogorgia americana was the most abundant species. The mean percent of live coral (including hydrocorals) was 22.30{\%} (SE=1.73) (15.45{\%} for dead coral, SE=3.28). Dead coral had the highest percentage of dissimilarity between sites (9.21{\%}) (ANOSIM) and 16.57{\%} contribution (SIMPER analysis). Octocoral live cover ranged from 0 to 21.35{\%} with a mean of 6.38{\%} (SE=0.99).

abstract = {We describe a novel, field-deployable hyperspectral imaging system, called Hypersub, that allows noninvasivein situ mapping of the microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass distribution with a high spatial (sub-millimeter) and temporal (minutes) resolution over areas of 1 × 1 m. The biomass is derived from a log-transformed and near-infrared corrected reflectance hyperspectral index, which exhibits a linear relationship (R2 {\textgreater} 0.97) with the hlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in the euphotic zone of the sediment and depends on the sediment grainsize. Deployments of the system revealed that due to factors such as sediment topography, bioturbation, and grazing, the distribution of MPB in intertidal sediments is remarkably heterogeneous, with Chl a concentrations varying laterally by up to 400{\%} of the average value over a distance of 1 cm. Furthermore, due to tidal cycling nd diel light variability, MPB concentrations in the top 1 mm of sediments are very dynamic, changing by 40-0{\%} over a few hours due to vertical migration. We argue that the high-resolution hyperspectral imaging method overcomes the inadequate resolution of traditional methods based on sedimentary Chl a extraction, and thus helps improve our understanding of the processes that control benthic primary production in coastal sediments. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract Abyssal polymetallic nodule fields constitute an unusual deep-sea habitat. The mix of soft sediment and the hard substratum provided by nodules increases the complexity of these environments. Hard substrata typically support a very distinct fauna to that of seabed sediments, and its presence can play a major role in the structuring of benthic assemblages. We assessed the influence of seafloor nodule cover on the megabenthos of a marine conservation area (area of particular environmental interest 6) in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (3950?4250?m water depth) using extensive photographic surveys from an autonomous underwater vehicle. Variations in nodule cover (1?20{\%}) appeared to exert statistically significant differences in faunal standing stocks, some biological diversity attributes, faunal composition, functional group composition, and the distribution of individual species. The standing stock of both the metazoan fauna and the giant protists (xenophyophores) doubled with a very modest initial increase in nodule cover (from 1{\%} to 3{\%}). Perhaps contrary to expectation, we detected little if any substantive variation in biological diversity along the nodule cover gradient. Faunal composition varied continuously along the nodule cover gradient. We discuss these results in the context of potential seabed-mining operations and the associated sustainable management and conservation plans. We note in particular that successful conservation actions will likely require the preservation of areas comprising the full range of nodule cover and not just the low cover areas that are least attractive to mining.},

This is the third paper in a series to provide regional taxonomic data for a region that is undergoing intense deep-sea mineral exploration for high-grade polymetallic nodules. Taxonomic data are presented for 21 species from 42 records identified by a combination of morphological and genetic data, including molecular phylogenetic analyses. These included 3 heterodont bivalves, 5 protobranch bivalves, 4 pteriomorph bivalves, 1 caudofoveate, 1 monoplacophoran, 1 polyplacophoran, 4 scaphopods and 2 solenogastres. Gastropoda were recovered but will be the subject of a future study. Seven taxa matched published morphological descriptions for species with deep Pacific type localities, and our sequences provide the first genetic data for these taxa. One taxon morphologically matched a known cosmopolitan species but with a type locality in a different ocean basin and was assigned the open nomenclature ‘cf' as a precautionary approach in taxon assignments to avoid over-estimating species ranges. One taxon is here described as a new species, Ledella knudseni sp. n. For the remaining 12 taxa, we have determined them to be potentially new species, for which we make the raw data, imagery and vouchers available for future taxonomic study. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone is a region undergoing intense exploration for potential deep-sea mineral extraction.

The citizens average classification accuracy (79 percent) was relatively high compared to marine scientists (assumed 100 percent), but variability in most participants accuracy was also high.

abstract = {Abstract The paper describes a joint industry project (JIP) conducted to provide an independent review of the current Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) regulations and the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards (including their historical development). The main objective of the JIP was to make recommendations for improving industry's state-of-practice including revising regulations as needed to reflect the best methods for conducting deepwater geotechnical investigations. The study provides a careful review of all regulations applicable to an integrated site investigation required for the foundation design of a permanent floating production system. A panel of experts in offshore geotechnical engineering was assembled to obtain their technical guidance for defining the most appropriate work scope for an offshore geotechnical investigation for a permanently moored production system. The study describes the progress that has been made in site investigation technology (continuous sampling and insitu testing methods) and interpretation of the data since the regulations were initially published. The study also discusses how the current regulations should be interpreted in light of these recent advancements, as applied to the foundation design of suction piles, plate anchors, or driven piles. The expert panel also recommended revising the regulatory text to ensure that best field practices and sound engineering design principles can be employed when designing foundations to be safe and accomplish their intended purpose. The major benefit of the revised regulatory text is avoiding ambiguity between regulators and practicing geotechnical engineers as to what constitutes best practices for conducting a deepwater integrated site investigation. Introduction On December 27, 2001, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) published amended requirements in the Federal Register (30 CFR 250) to address the design of Floating Production Systems (FPSs). The purpose was to incorporate into their regulations a body of industry standards pertaining to FPSs so that system designers would know what is acceptable. Instead of writing their own standards, MMS determined that it would be most efficient and provide the highest level of expertise to the regulatory process if they incorporated the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards. In recent years, practicing geotechnical engineers working on deepwater offshore projects worldwide have found that establishing the scope of an offshore site investigation is often difficult. The difficulty lies in the ambiguity in the regulations leading to a lack of consensus among regulators, certified verification authorities (CVAs), and practicing geotechnical engineers as to requirements for conducting site investigations for deepwater projects. Since the new requirements (30 CFR 250) were published over a decade ago, the practice of conducting deepwater site investigations has dramatically improved. Today, high quality, digital geophysical data is routinely acquired very efficiently with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The suite of data such as swath-bathymetry, sub-bottom profiles, and side-scan sonar imagery can be interpreted and mapped to provide a clear 3D picture of the seafloor and subsurface geologic/sediment conditions. More innovative site investigation methods have been developed for obtaining large diameter continuous samples (Jumbo Piston Core - JPC), performing continuous cone penetration test (CPT) soundings and combining these data with the geophysical survey data into an integrated geologic/geotechnical model.},

abstract = {AbstractGeohazards remain to be a significant risk-driver in deepwater oil and gas developments. However, there are no industry standards and few guidelines for managing deepwater risk. This paper presents a method for an iterative process which quantifies geohazard risk. The method takes into account facility vulnerability, geohazard probability and the impact on the development. The quantified geohazard risk assessment identifies the geohazard challenges for deepwater project feasibility and the potential major cost drivers. The approach provides an auditable process for evaluating the benefits and costs of risk reduction measures and environmental compliance. Furthermore the assessment shows which particular geohazards contribute most to the total project risk allowing operators to focus their resources on the geohazard that matters most.IntroductionOil and gas developments in deepwater face new challenges every year, both on technical issues such as facility and well engineering as in the unknowns of the physical processes, soil conditions and environments that occur at large water depths. Many recent highprofile deepwater developments continue to encounter major geological hazards (i.e. geohazards) on an increasing scale.The significance of geohazards depends on the nature and intensity of the hazard and the engineering performance or vulnerability of the structures that they interact with: some geohazards present a challenge to project feasibility or impose significant additional costs, whilst the effects of others can be mitigated by appropriate facility engineering design.Historically, geohazard-induced losses to the onshore oil and gas industry exceed many hundreds of millions of dollars through replacement costs, contractual claims and loss of production. In the offshore environment, geohazard-induced losses are potentially far greater as a result of damage to well casings, seabed facilities, pipelines and platforms (e.g. the damage to seabed facilities and losses in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Ivan in September 2004). The potential losses are further compounded by the higher capital investments, intensive use of new technology and bigger platforms putting more investment and lives at risk.Geohazards, especially in deepwater, can be an important contributor to the total project risk. This has prompted several leading operating companies to assemble an expert Geohazard Assessment Team (GAT) to evaluate the level of geological and geotechnical complexity of proposed development sites early on in the project. A key feature of the GAT is the integration of experts from key disciplines (geomorphology, geology, geophysics, geotechnics) to conduct a systematic interpretation and analysis of geohazard risk; the method developed by the GAT provides a framework for estimating:the frequency at which different geohazard events could be expected to cause loss to the project; andthe level of financial loss associated with the different geohazard events.The evaluation of geohazard risk is an iterative process throughout the development programme. A key output of each iterative phase of the geohazard risk assessment (GRA) is to highlight the uncertainties in data and knowledge and to make appropriate recommendations for geophysical data acquisition, geotechnical investigation, in-situ monitoring and further analytical work.},

abstract = {Xenophyophores, giant foraminifera, are distinctive members of the deep-sea megafauna that accumulate large masses of waste material (‘stercomare') within their agglutinated tests, and organise their cells as branching strands enclosed within an organic tube (the ‘granellare' system). Using non-destructive, three-dimensional micro-CT imaging we explored these structures in three species from the abyssal eastern Pacific Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). In Psammina spp., the low-density stercomare occupied much of the test interior, while high-density granellare strands branched throughout the structure. In Galatheammina sp. the test comprised a mixture of stercomare and test particles, with the granellare forming a web-like system of filaments. The granellare occupied 2.8–5.1{\%}, the stercomare 72.4–82.4{\%}, and test particles 14.7–22.5{\%}, of the ‘body' volume in the two Psammina species. The corresponding proportions in Galatheammina sp. were 1.7{\%} (granellare), 39.5{\%} (stercomare) and 58.8{\%} (test particles). These data provide a potential basis for estimating the contribution of xenophyophores to seafloor biomass in areas like the CCZ where they dominate the megafauna. As in most xenophyophore species, the granellare hosted huge numbers of tiny barite crystals. We speculate that these help to support the extensive granellare system, as well as reducing the cell volume and lightening the metabolic burden required to maintain it.},

This study examined the spatial extent of habitats of five megafaunal species with different levels of mobility [(1) the shrimp, Nematocarcinus sp. (benthic, comparatively low mobility); (2) the galatheid crab, Shinkaia crosnieri (benthic, low mobility); (3) the lithodid crab, Paralomis sp.

(demersal, high mobility)], which are associated with a deep-sea hydrothermal field in the Oki-nawa Trough. We obtained species presence-absence and abiotic environmental data (water temperature, proportional coverage of soft-sediment area, water depth, and five bathymetric parameters) from observation records by deep-sea submersibles and conducted a spatial analysis using three types of statistical models and a multi-model ensemble forecasting method. We prepared 10 data sets of the environmental variables by changing the spatial resolution from finer 0.00005° (ca. 5.3 m) to coarser 0.0005° (ca. 52.5 m). Accuracy of the models for the benthic species with comparatively low mobility was higher than that for the benthic and demersal species with high mobility and enhanced with decreasing grid-cell size (finer resolutions) of environmental data. By contrast, the accuracy of the models for the latter group varied more gently with the changing spatial resolution. The results showed that the proposed method is potentially useful to map the local-scale spatial distribution of the target species, sedentary benthic animals in particular, and that considering an appropriate spatial resolution in predicting the species distributions is important. These findings will help to enable management and subsequent conservation of deep-sea ecosystems.},

abstract = {The potential for imminent abyssal polymetallic nodule exploitation has raised considerable scientific attention. The interface between the targeted nodule resource and sediment in this unusual mosaic habitat promotes the development of some of the most biologically diverse communities in the abyss. However, the ecology of these remote ecosystems is still poorly understood, so it is unclear to what extent and timescale these ecosystems will be affected by, and could recover from, mining disturbance. Using data inferred from seafloor photo-mosaics, we show that the effects of simulated mining impacts, induced during the “DISturbance and reCOLonization experiment” (DISCOL) conducted in 1989, were still evident in the megabenthos of the Peru Basin after 26 years. Suspension-feeder presence remained significantly reduced in disturbed areas, while deposit-feeders showed no diminished presence in disturbed areas, for the first time since the experiment began. Nevertheless, we found significantly lower heterogeneity diversity in disturbed areas and markedly distinct faunal compositions along different disturbance levels. If the results of this experiment at DISCOL can be extrapolated to the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, the impacts of polymetallic nodule mining there may be greater than expected, and could potentially lead to an irreversible loss of some ecosystem functions, especially in directly disturbed areas.},

abstract = {Abstract. Visual sampling techniques represent a valuable resource for a rapid, non-invasive data acquisition for underwater monitoring purposes. Long-term monitoring projects usually requires the collection of large quantities of data, and the visual analysis of a human expert operator remains, in this context, a very time consuming task. It has been estimated that only the 1-2{\%} of the acquired images are later analyzed by scientists (Beijbom et al., 2012). Strategies for the automatic recognition of benthic communities are required to effectively exploit all the information contained in visual data. Supervised learning methods, the most promising classification techniques in this field, are commonly affected by two recurring issues: the wide diversity of marine organism, and the small amount of labeled data. In this work, we discuss the advantages offered by the use of annotated high resolution ortho-mosaics of seabed to classify and segment the investigated specimens, and we suggest several strategies to obtain a considerable per-pixel classification performance although the use of a reduced training dataset composed by a single ortho-mosaic. The proposed methodology can be applied to a large number of different species, making the procedure of marine organism identification an highly adaptable task.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-temporal underwater photogrammetric survey of a reef patch located in Moorea, French Polynesia, designed to detect a coral growth of 10–15 mm/year. Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and underwater imagery allows the three-dimensional quantification of reef structural complexity and ecologically relevant characteristics at the patch scale. A high degree of accuracy and fine resolution are required in order to guarantee the repeatability of surveys over time within the same reference system, meaning a proper geodetic network and acquisition scheme are mandatory. Measuring tools and reference points were properly designed in order to constrain the photogrammetric reconstruction. The network adjustment, performed with distance and height difference observations, provided an average accuracy of ± 1.2 mm and ± 2.9 mm in the horizontal and vertical components, respectively. The final accuracies of photogrammetric reconstructions are on the order of 1 cm and few millimeters for the 2017 and 2018 monitoring campaigns, respectively. This results in realized errors in the comparison of about ± 1 cm. Coordinate variations larger than this magnitude can be reasonably interpreted as coral growth or dissolution. The direct comparison of the two subsequent point clouds is effective in order to evaluate trends in growth and perform morphometric analyses. For highly accurate quantitative assessment of local changes, an expert operator can create and analyze specific 2D profiles that are easily produced from the point clouds.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes are rich distributions over functions, which provide a Bayesian nonparametric approach to smoothing and interpolation. We introduce simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns and enable extrapolation. These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density - the Fourier transform of a kernel - with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data. We also show that it is possible to reconstruct several popular standard covariances within our framework. Copyright 2013 by the author(s).},

As a result, they are rapidly gaining popularity and attention from the computer vision research community. There has been a massive increase in the collection of digital imagery for the monitoring of underwater ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. This growth in image data has driven the need for automatic detection and classification using deep neural network based classifiers. This paper systematically describes the use of deep learning for underwater imagery analysis within the recent past. The analysis approaches are categorized according to the object of detection, and the features and deep learning architectures used are highlighted. It is concluded that there is a great scope for automation in the analysis of digital seabed imagery using deep neural networks, especially for the detection and monitoring of seagrass.},

abstract = {Maximizing information gathered within a budget is a relevant problem for information gathering tasks for robots with cost or operating time constraints. This problem is also known as the informative path planning (IPP) problem or correlated orienteering. It can be formalized as that of finding budgeted routes in a graph such that the reward collected by the route is maximized, where the reward at nodes can be dependent. Unfortunately, the problem is NP-Hard and the state of the art methods are too slow to even present an approximate solution online. Here we present Randomized Anytime Orienteering (RAOr) algorithm that provides near optimal solutions while demonstrably converging to an efficient solution in runtimes that allows the solver to be run online. The key idea of our approach is to pose orienteering as a combination of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem and a Traveling Salesman Problem. This formulation allows us to restrict the search space to routes that incur minimum distance to visit a set of selected nodes, and rapidly search this space using random sampling. The paper provides the analysis of asymptotic near-optimality, convergence rates for RAOr algorithms, and present strategies to improve anytime performance of the algorithm. Our experimental results suggest an improvement by an order of magnitude over the state of the art methods in relevant simulation and in real world scenarios.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on adaptive sampling on a Gaussian Processes (GP) using the receding-horizon Cross-Entropy (CE) trajectory optimization. Specifically, we employ the GP upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) as the optimization criteria to adaptively plan sampling paths that balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off. Path planning at the initial stage focuses on exploring and learning a model of the environment, and later, on exploiting the learned model to focus sampling around regions that exhibit extreme sensory measurements and much higher spatial variability, denoted as the Region of Interest (ROI). The integration of the CE trajectory optimization allows the sampling density to be dynamically adjusted based on the latest sensory measurements, thus providing an efficient sampling strategy for sensing and localizing the ROI. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in exploring simulated scalar fields with single or multiple ROIs. Field experiments with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) in a coastal bathymetry mapping mission validate the approach's capability in quickly exploring and mapping the given area, and then focusing and increasing the sampling density around the deepest region, as a surrogate for e.g. the extremal concentration of a pollutant in the environment.},

abstract = {One prerequisite to the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) across disciplines is differentiating ground from nonground returns. The objective was to automatically and objectively classify points within unclassified LiDAR point clouds, with few model parameters and minimal postprocessing. Presented is an automated method for classifying LiDAR returns as ground or nonground in forested environments occurring in complex terrains. Multiscale curvature classification (MCC) is an iterative multiscale algorithm for classifying LiDAR returns that exceed positive surface curvature thresholds, resulting in all the LiDAR measurements being classified as ground or nonground. The MCC algorithm yields a solution of classified returns that support bare-earth surface interpolation at a resolution commensurate with the sampling frequency of the LiDAR survey. Errors in classified ground returns were assessed using 204 independent validation points consisting of 165 field plot global positioning system locations and 39 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Geodetic Survey monuments. Jackknife validation and Monte Carlo simulation were used to assess the quality and error of a bare-earth digital elevation model interpolated from the classified returns. A local indicator of spatial association statistic was used to test for commission errors in the classified ground returns. Results demonstrate that the MCC model minimizes commission errors while retaining a high proportion of ground returns and provides high confidence in the derived ground surface.},

Also in underwater archeology, 3D models are often created using underwater optical imagery. In this paper, we focus on the aspect of detecting small changes in the coral reef using a multi-temporal photogrammetric modelling approach, which requires a high quality control network. We show that the quality of a good geodetic network limits the direct change detection, i.e., without any further registration process. As the photogrammetric accuracy is expected to exceed the geodetic network accuracy by at least one order of magnitude, we suggest to do a fine registration based on a number of signalized points.

abstract = {1. If marine environments are to be systematically protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then identification of the types of marine habitats and the communities they contain, and delineation of their boundaries utilizing a consistent classification is required. Human impacts on defined communities can then be assessed, the 'health' of these communities can be monitored, and marine protected areas can be designated as appropriate. 2. Schemes to classify habitats at local and regional scales, according to their geophysical properties, may identify different factors as determinants, and/or use them in different sequences in a hierarchical classification. We examined the reasons for these differences in local and regional applications of a global concept, and argue that a common set of factors could be applied in a defined and defensible sequence to produce a common hierarchy of habitat types among geographic regions. 3. We show how simple mapping and GIS techniques, based on readily available data, can lead to the identification of representative habitat types over broad geographic regions. We applied a geophysical framework first to the entire Canadian coastline and second to the Scotian Shelf of Atlantic Canada to establish broad scale marine natural regions and 'seascapes', respectively. This ecosystem level approach - which defines representative habitat types - is a fundamental prerequisite for many purposes. It can form the basis for further analyses including: definition of community types from habitat - community relationships; evaluation of the potential roles of focal species in marine conservation; evaluation of candidate marine protected areas; definition of unaffected reference areas against which the effects of human activities can be gauged; guidance for water quality monitoring studies; management of marine resources.

However, deciding when and where to take measurements in complex environments remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a new multiresolution mapping approach for informative path planning in terrain monitoring using UAVs. Our strategy exploits the spatial correlation encoded in a Gaussian Process model as a prior for Bayesian data fusion with probabilistic sensors. This allows us to incorporate altitude-dependent sensor models for aerial imaging and perform constant-time measurement updates. The resulting maps are used to plan information-rich trajectories in continuous 3-D space through a combination of grid search and evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our framework on the application of agricultural biomass monitoring. Extensive simulations show that our planner performs better than existing methods, with mean error reductions of up to 45{\%} compared to traditional 'lawnmower' coverage. We demonstrate proof of concept using a multirotor to map color in different environments.},

In fact, structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry coupled with imagery acquired by UAVs offers a rapid and inexpensive tool to produce high-resolution orthomosaics, giving ecologists a new way for responsive, timely, and cost-effective monitoring of ecological processes. Here, we adopted a lightweight quadcopter as an aerial survey tool and object-based image analysis (OBIA) workflow to demonstrate the strength of such methods in producing very high spatial resolution maps of sensitive marine habitats. Therefore, three different coastal environments were mapped using the autonomous flight capability of a lightweight UAV equipped with a fully stabilized consumer-grade RGB digital camera. In particular we investigated a Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow, a rocky coast with nurseries for juvenile fish, and two sandy areas showing biogenic reefs of Sabelleria alveolata. We adopted, for the first time, UAV-based raster thematic maps of these key coastal habitats, produced after OBIA classification, as a new method for fine-scale, low-cost, and time saving characterization of sensitive marine environments which may lead to a more effective and efficient monitoring and management of natural resources.},

abstract = {Robotic sampling is attractive in many field robotics applications that require persistent collection of physical samples for ex-situ analysis. Examples abound in the earth sciences in studies involving the collection of rock, soil, and water samples for laboratory analysis. In our test domain, marine ecosystem monitoring, detailed understanding of plankton ecology requires laboratory analysis of water samples, but predictions using physical and chemical properties measured in real-time by sensors aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can guide sample collection decisions. In this paper, we present a data-driven and opportunistic sampling strategy to minimize cumulative regret for batches of plankton samples acquired by an AUV over multiple surveys. Samples are labeled at the end of each survey, and used to update a probabilistic model that guides sampling during subsequent surveys. During a survey, the AUV makes irrevocable sample collection decisions online for a sequential stream of candidates, with no knowledge of the quality of future samples. In addition to extensive simulations using historical field data, we present results from a one-day field trial where beginning with a prior model learned from data collected and labeled in an earlier campaign, the AUV collected water samples with a high abundance of a pre-specified planktonic target. This is the first time such a field experiment has been carried out in its entirety in a data-driven fashion, in effect "closing the loop" on a significant and relevant ecosystem monitoring problem while allowing domain experts (marine ecologists) to specify the mission at a relatively high level.},

abstract = {The process of learning good features for ma- chine learning applications can be very compu- tationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototyp- ical example of this is the one-shot learning set- ting, in which we must correctly make predic- tions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity be- tween inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discrimina- tive features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art perfor- mance on one-shot classification tasks.},

abstract = {Observing that Semantic features learned in an image classification task and Appearance features learned in a similarity matching task complement each other, we build a twofold Siamese network, named SA-Siam, for real-time object tracking. SA-Siam is composed of a semantic branch and an appearance branch. Each branch is a similaritylearning Siamese network. An important design choice in SA-Siam is to separately train the two branches to keep the heterogeneity of the two types of features. In addition, we propose a channel attention mechanism for the semantic branch. Channel-wise weights are computed according to the channel activations around the target position. While the inherited architecture from SiamFC [3] allows our tracker to operate beyond real-time, the twofold design and the attention mechanism significantly improve the tracking performance. The proposed SA-Siam outperforms all other real-time trackers by a large margin on OTB-2013/50/100 benchmarks.},

This study describes the test of two new methods to perform georeferenced underwater photogrammetry. The first one uses the coupling between photogrammetry by scuba diving and positioning with acoustic data from a multibeam echo sounder; the second one utilises direct positioning technology with a surface floating device (photogrammetric platform). When compared with one another, the platform had a higher mapping efficiency, while being limited by depth and underwater visibility.

This is especially the case for smartphones, that are powerful enough and sufficiently widespread to perform a huge variety of activities (e.g. paying, calling, communication, photography, navigation, localization, etc.), including just very recently the possibility of running 3D reconstruction pipelines.

This article presents the REPLICATE project's concept and some of the ongoing activities, with particular attention being paid to advances made in the first year of work. Thus the article focuses on the system architecture definition, selection of optimal frames for 3D cloud reconstruction, automated generation of sparse and dense point clouds, mesh modelling techniques and post-processing actions. Experiments so far were concentrated on indoor objects and some simple heritage artefacts, however, in the long term we will be targeting a larger variety of scenarios and communities.},

This paper addresses the lack of systematic analysis of 3D reconstruction and navigation fusion strategies, as well as associated error evaluation of models produced at larger scales in GPS-denied environments using a monocular camera (often in deep sea scenarios). Based on our prior work on automatic scale estimation of SfM-based 3D models using laser scalers, an automatic scale accuracy framework is presented. The confidence level for each of the scale error estimates is independently assessed through the propagation of the uncertainties associated with image features and laser spot detections using a Monte Carlo simulation. The number of iterations used in the simulation was validated through the analysis of the final estimate behavior. To facilitate the detection and uncertainty estimation of even greatly attenuated laser beams, an automatic laser spot detection method was developed, with the main novelty of estimating the uncertainties based on the recovered characteristic shapes of laser spots with radially decreasing intensities. The effects of four different reconstruction strategies resulting from the combinations of Incremental/Global SfM, and the a priori and a posteriori use of navigation data were analyzed using two distinct survey scenarios captured during the SUBSAINTES 2017 cruise (doi: 10.17600/17001000). The study demonstrates that surveys with multiple overlaps of nonsequential images result in a nearly identical solution regardless of the strategy (SfM or navigation fusion), while surveys with weakly connected sequentially acquired images are prone to produce broad-scale deformation (doming effect) when navigation is not included in the optimization. Thus the scenarios with complex survey patterns substantially benefit from using multiobjective BA navigation fusion. The errors in models, produced by the most appropriate strategy, were estimated at around 1 {\%} in the central parts and always inferior to 5 {\%} on the extremities. The effects of combining data from multiple surveys were also evaluated. The introduction of additional vectors in the optimization of multisurvey problems successfully accounted for offset changes present in the underwater USBL-based navigation data, and thus minimize the effect of contradicting navigation priors. Our results also illustrate the importance of collecting a multitude of evaluation data at different locations and moments during the survey.},

abstract = {Unoccupied Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are growing in importance and capabilities. Here, the trajectory control of an UUV carrying an object is investigated, with the consequent changes in system dynamics. For the first time, an Adaptive Model Predictive Control (AMPC) scheme for UUVs is developed, which selects optimal actions at the start of every time step to minimise the trajectory tracking error and prevent excessive changes in the control action over a receding time horizon. Prediction error minimisation is used to identify the linear model of the UUV in real time. The performance of AMPC is compared with existing PID and sliding-mode control (SMC) strategies through simulations. The latter is improved to prevent integral wind-up. While SMC results in best tracking performance, it imposes a strong burden on the motors due to its bang-bang action selection. AMPC presents smoother changes in applied thrust, but higher tracking errors due to non-linear effects and inaccuracies in the on-line system identification process. PID presents best overall performance, but its behaviour is expected to degrade on an actual ROV application due to sensor noise. This study will contribute to the selection of a suitable control scheme for future UUVs performing maintenance tasks autonomously.},

Specifically, we consider online receding horizon based planners that need to operate in a latent environment where the latent information can be modeled via Gaussian Processes. Online path planning in latent environments is challenging since the robot needs to explore the environment to get a more accurate model of latent information for better planning later and also achieves the task as quick as possible. We propose UCB style algorithms that are popular in the bandit settings and show how those analyses can be adapted to the online robotic path planning problems. The proposed algorithm trades-off exploration and exploitation in near-optimal manner and has appealing no-regret properties. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework on the application of aircraft flight path planning when the winds are partially observed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Functional diversity (FD) metrics quantify the trait diversity in biological assemblages and act as a proxy for the diverse ecological functions performed in the community. Analyses of FD offer a potentially useful tool to identify functional changes in diverse, complex, and disturbed marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, yet this metric is rarely applied to evaluate community change. Here, we documented spatio-temporal variability in the trophic function of fish assemblages to identify changes in coral reef communities inside the Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) in the U.S. Virgin Islands between 2002 and 2010, which included an intense coral bleaching event in 2005. We combined six trait categories related to the trophic function of 95 fish species together with species biomass estimated from underwater surveys to calculate assemblage-level descriptors of functional richness (FRic), dispersion (FDis), and evenness. We tested the effects of habitat type, time, and their interaction on fish FD using a non−parametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance. We found statistically significant differences for FRic and FDis between habitat types and survey years. Coral reef and other hard bottom areas supported highest levels of trophic functional richness and variation, but low functional redundancy. Fish species exhibited high functional uniqueness within the functional trait space suggesting that a significant decline in fish diversity in the BIRNM would likely result in loss of trophic functions from the fish community. Detection of temporal variations in functional trait composition subsequent to the mass coral bleaching event in 2005 indicates that FD descriptors are sensitive enough to track shifts in the emergent trophic organization of fish communities. In the BIRNM, the trophic organization in fish assemblages did not return to the pre-bleaching state even after five years of monitoring. We demonstrate a novel way to monitor resilience to disturbance by plotting and tracking the centroid of the functional trait space through time. Our findings demonstrate the utility of FD descriptors to evaluate changes to the functional integrity of diverse and spatially heterogeneous habitat structure across the seascape.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017. We present an approach to motion planning under motion and sensing un-certainty, formally described as a continuous partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Our approach is designed for non-linear dynamics and observation models, and follows the general POMDP solution framework in which we represent beliefs by Gaussian distributions, approximate the belief dynamics using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and represent the value function by a quadratic function that is valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. Using a variant of differential dynamic programming, our approach iterates with second-order convergence towards a linear control policy over the belief space that is locally-optimal with respect to a user-defined cost function. Unlike previous work, our approach does not assume maximum-likelihood observations, does not assume fixed estimator or control gains, takes into account obstacles in the environment, and does not require discretization of the belief space. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial in the dimension of the state space. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in several continuous partially-observable planning domains with obstacles for robots with non-linear dynamics and observation models.},

abstract = {We propose three sampling-based motion planning algorithms for generating informative mobile robot trajectories. The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information quality metric (e.g. variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e.g. fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed rapidly exploring information gathering (RIG) algorithms combine ideas from sampling-based motion planning with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient information gathering in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques find optimal solutions more quickly than existing combinatorial solvers, and we provide a proof-of-concept field implementation on an autonomous surface vehicle performing a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to modeling curiosity in a mobile robot, which is useful for monitoring and adaptive data collection tasks, especially in the context of long term autonomous missions where pre-programmed missions are likely to have limited utility. We use a realtime topic modeling technique to build a semantic perception model of the environment, using which, we plan a path through the locations in the world with high semantic information content. The life-long learning behavior of the proposed perception model makes it suitable for long-term exploration missions. We validate the approach using simulated exploration experiments using aerial and underwater data, and demonstrate an implementation on the Aqua underwater robot in a variety of scenarios. We find that the proposed exploration paths that are biased towards locations with high topic perplexity, produce better terrain models with high discriminative power. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm implemented on Aqua robot is able to do tasks such as coral reef inspection, diver following, and sea floor exploration, without any prior training or preparation.},

abstract = {Robotic science missions in remote environments, such as deep ocean and outer space, can involve studying phenomena that cannot directly be observed using on-board sensors but must be deduced by combining measurements of correlated variables with domain knowledge. Traditionally, in such missions, robots passively gather data along prescribed paths, while inference, path planning, and other high level decision making is largely performed by a supervisory science team. However, communication constraints hinder these processes, and hence the rate of scientific progress. This paper presents an active perception approach that aims to reduce robots' reliance on human supervision and improve science productivity by encoding scientists' domain knowledge and decision making process on-board. We use Bayesian networks to compactly model critical aspects of scientific knowledge while remaining robust to observation and modeling uncertainty. We then formulate path planning and sensor scheduling as an information gain maximization problem, and propose a sampling-based solution based on Monte Carlo tree search to plan informative sensing actions which exploit the knowledge encoded in the network. The computational complexity of our framework does not grow with the number of observations taken and allows long horizon planning in an anytime manner, making it highly applicable to field robotics. Simulation results show statistically significant performance improvements over baseline methods, and we validate the practicality of our approach through both hardware experiments and simulated experiments with field data gathered during the NASA Mojave Volatiles Prospector science expedition.},

@article{Fukunaga2019,
abstract = {Long-term ecological monitoring of reef fish populations often requires the simultaneous collection of data on benthic habitats in order to account for the effects of these variables on fish assemblage structure. Here, we described an approach to benthic surveys that uses photogrammetric techniques to facilitate the extraction of quantitative metrics for characterization of benthic habitats from the resulting three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of coral reefs. Out of 92 sites surveyed in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, photographs from 85 sites achieved complete alignment and successfully produced 3D reconstructions and digital elevation models (DEMs). Habitat metrics extracted from the DEMs were generally correlated with one another, with the exception of curvature measures, indicating that complexity and curvature measures should be treated separately when quantifying the habitat structure. Fractal dimension D64, calculated by changing resolutions of the DEMs from 1 cm to 64 cm, had the best correlations with other habitat metrics. Fractal dimension was also less affected by changes in orientations of the models compared to surface complexity or slope. These results showed that fractal dimension can be used as a single measure of complexity for the characterization of coral reef habitats. Further investigations into metrics for 3D characterization of habitats should consider relevant spatial scales and focus on obtaining variables that can complement fractal dimension in the characterization of reef habitats.},

abstract = {Autonomous Science is a field of study which aims to extend the autonomy of exploration robots from low level functionality, such as on-board perception and obstacle avoidance, to science autonomy, which allows scientists to specify missions at task level. This will enable more remote and extreme environments such as deep ocean and other planets to be studied, leading to significant science discoveries. This paper presents an approach to extend the high level autonomy of robots by enabling them to model and reason about scientific knowledge on-board. We achieve this by using Bayesian networks to encode scientific knowledge and adapting Monte Carlo Tree Search techniques to reason about the network and plan informative sensing actions. The resulting knowledge representation and reasoning framework is anytime, handles large state spaces and robust to uncertainty making it highly applicable to field robotics. We apply the approach to a Mars exploration mission in which the robot is required to plan paths and decide when to use its sensing modalities to study a scientific latent variable of interest. Extensive simulation results show that our approach has significant performance benefits over alternative methods. We also demonstrate the practicality of our approach in an analog Martian environment where our experimental rover, Continuum, plans and executes a science mission autonomously.},

abstract = {We present a simple, standardized assay, the squidpop, for measuring the relative feeding intensity of generalist predators in aquatic systems. The assay consists of a 1.3-cm diameter disk of dried squid mantle tethered to a rod, which is either inserted in the sediment in softbottom habitats or secured to existing structure. Each replicate squidpop is scored as present or absent after 1 and 24 hours, and the data for analysis are proportions of replicate units consumed at each time. Tests in several habitats of the temperate southeastern USA (Virginia and North Carolina) and tropical Central America (Belize) confirmed the assay's utility for measuring variation in predation intensity among habitats, among seasons, and along environmental gradients. In Belize, predation intensity varied strongly among habitats, with reef  {\textgreater}  seagrass = mangrove  {\textgreater}  unvegetated bare sand. Quantitative visual surveys confirmed that assayed feeding intensity increased with abundance and species richness of fishes across sites, with fish abundance and richness explaining up to 45{\%}and 70{\%}of the variation in bait loss respectively. In the southeastern USA, predation intensity varied seasonally, being highest during summer and declining in late autumn. Deployments in marsh habitats generally revealed a decline in mean predation intensity from fully marine to tidal freshwater sites. The simplicity, economy, and standardization of the squidpop assay should facilitate engagement of scientists and citizens alike, with the goal of constructing high-resolution maps of how top-down control varies through space and time in aquatic ecosystems, and addressing a broad array of long-standing hypotheses in macro- and community ecology.},

abstract = {Most data visualization systems only show static data or produce "canned" movies of time-varying data. Others incorporate visualization in real-time monitoring but these are generally customized to the particular application. The ability to interactively navigate through geospatial data is common but interactive navigation along the time dimension is not. And yet, visualization of data from interacting dynamic systems is increasingly necessary to interpret biological process, physical oceanographic processes, the motion of instrument platforms (such as ships, ROVs and AUVs), and the interactions between all of these. To address this need, GeoZui3D system has been enhanced so that it seamlessly handles multiple time varying data sets: anything can be handled that can be represented through time varying surfaces, curved colored lines, curved colored tubes, arrow arrays, or color-, shape-, and size-coded points. The system can be used in both real-time and replay modes and data sets that have different sampling rates can still be visualized together. GeoZui3D can visualize events over a wide range of time scales from sensor readings at the millisecond scale to glacial movements evolving over tens of thousands of years. The system is illustrated with examples from collaborative research projects including modeled ocean and estuarine currents, tides, ship movements, changes in surface topography, AUV and ROV movements and the movements of marine mammals.},

abstract = {Decision making under uncertainty is a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex robotics scenarios. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, designed to solve this problem, was subject to much work lately. Most POMDP solvers, however, focus on planning in discrete state, action and/or observations spaces, which does not truly reflect the complexity of most real world problems. This paper addresses the issue by devising a method for solving POMDPs with continuous state, action and observations spaces. The proposed planner, Continuous Belief Tree Search (CBTS), uses Bayesian Optimisation (BO) to dynamically sample promising actions while constructing a belief tree. This dynamic sampling allows for richer action selection than offline action discretisation. CBTS is complemented by a novel trajectory generation technique, relying on the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), yielding trajectories amenable for robotics applications. The resulting trajectory planner kCBTS outperforms other continuous planners on space modelling and robot parking problems.},

Toward developing guidelines for view-linking devices, we have carried out two experiments that compare the utility of three different classes of linking devices: a directional proxy, tethers from one view to another, and a track-up map coupling. The task we apply them to is what we call the multi-perspective identification task: subjects are asked to identify an item seen in a local, forward-looking view in the context of a global, overhead view. Our results indicate that the directional proxy is the most beneficial device, and that the track-up map coupling is also beneficial. The results suggest that tethers provide little benefit. The results also suggest that when multiple local views are present, it may be beneficial to emphasize one window as being of primary interest.},

A control strategy for path following of linear paths for under-actuated autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is presented. We consider the case in which an unknown ocean current is affecting the system. We adopt a Luenberger observer to estimate the current. The desired orientation of the vehicles is assigned using a rotation matrix, and this is defined using the estimated vector of the ocean current and a vector containing the cross track error. Since the desired orientation is given in the form of a rotation matrix, an attitude error function defined on the SO(2) group is used in order to define an orientation error. The desired surge velocity is defined based on the ocean current estimate in order to counteract the current and keep a desired along-path velocity (speed over ground). Based on a mathematical model describing both the kinematics and dynamics of the vehicles, and using cascaded systems theory, almost semi-global asymptotic stability (almost-SGAS) is proven. Simulation results are included that validate the theoretical result.},

abstract = {Information gathering (IG) algorithms aim to intelligently select a mobile sensor actions required to efficiently obtain an accurate reconstruction of a physical process, such as an occupancy map, or a magnetic field. Many recent works have proposed algorithms for IG that employ Gaussian processes (GPs) as underlying model of the process. However, most algorithms discretize the state space, which makes them computationally intractable for robotic systems with complex dynamics. Moreover, they are not suited for online information gathering tasks as they assume prior knowledge about GP parameters. This paper presents a novel approach that tackles the two aforementioned issues. Specifically, our approach includes two intertwined steps: (i) a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) search that allows a robot to identify unvisited locations, and to learn the GP parameters, and (ii) an RRT*-based informative path planning that guides the robot towards those locations by maximizing the information gathered while minimizing path cost. The combination of the two steps allows an online realization of the algorithm, while eliminating the need for discretization. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art both in simulations, and in a lab experiment in which a ground-based robot explores the magnetic field intensity within an indoor environment populated with obstacles.},

abstract = {Coastal upwelling is a wind-driven ocean process. It brings cooler, saltier, and usually nutrient-rich deep water upward to the surface. The boundary between the upwelling water and the normally stratified water is called the 'upwelling front'. Upwelling fronts support enriched phytoplankton and zooplankton populations, thus having great influences on ocean ecosystems. In our prior work, we developed and field demonstrated a method of using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously identify an upwelling front, map the vertical structure across the front, and track the front's movement on a fixed latitude (i.e., one-dimensional tracking). In this paper we present an extension of the method for mapping and tracking an upwelling front on both latitudinal and longitudinal dimensions (i.e., two-dimensional) using an AUV. Each time the AUV crosses and detects the meandering front, the vehicle makes a turn at an oblique angle to recross the front, thus zigzagging through the front to map it. The AUV's zigzag tracks alternate in northward and southward sweeps, so as to track the front as it moves over time. From 29 May to 4 June 2013, the Tethys long-range AUV ran the algorithm to autonomously detect and track an upwelling front in Monterey Bay, CA. The AUV repeatedly mapped the frontal zone over an area of about 200 km2 in more than five days. {\textcopyright} 2013 MTS.},

We propose two information functions and their variants for fast and online computations. We prove an information-theoretic convergence for an entire exploration and information gathering mission based on the least upper bound of the average map entropy. A natural automatic stopping criterion for information-driven motion control results from the convergence analysis.

abstract = {This paper introduces the applicability of underwater photogrammetric survey within challenging conditions as the main tool to enhance and enrich the process of documenting archaeological excavation through the creation of 4D models. Photogrammetry was being attempted on underwater archaeological sites at least as early as the 1970s' and today the production of traditional 3D models is becoming a common practice within the discipline. Photogrammetry underwater is more often implemented to record exposed underwater archaeological remains and less so as a dynamic interpretative tool. Therefore, it tends to be applied in bright environments and when underwater visibility is {\textgreater} 1 m, reducing its implementation on most submerged archaeological sites in more turbid conditions. Recent years have seen significant development of better digital photographic sensors and the improvement of optical technology, ideal for darker environments. Such developments, in tandem with powerful processing computing systems, have allowed underwater photogrammetry to be used by this research as a standard recording and interpretative tool. Using multi-source photogrammetry (5, GoPro5 Hero Black cameras) this paper presents the accumulation of daily (4D) underwater surveys carried out in the Early Bronze Age (3300 BCE) to Late Ottoman (17th Century AD) archaeological site of Ropotamo in the Bulgarian Black Sea under challenging conditions ({\textless} 0.5 m visibility). It proves that underwater photogrammetry can and should be used as one of the main recording methods even in low light and poor underwater conditions as a way to better understand the complexity of the underwater archaeological record.},

abstract = {Abstract. Underwater photogrammetry is a well-established technique for measuring and modelling the subaquatic environment in fields ranging from archaeology to marine ecology. While for simple tasks the acquisition and processing of images have become straightforward, applications requiring relative accuracy better then 1:1000 are still considered challenging. This study focuses on the metric evaluation of different off-the-shelf camera systems for making high resolution and high accuracy measurements of coral reefs monitoring through time, where the variations to be measured are in the range of a few centimeters per year. High quality and low-cost systems (reflex and mirrorless vs action cameras, i.e. GoPro) with multiple lenses (prime and zoom), different fields of views (from fisheye to moderate wide angle), pressure housing materials and lens ports (dome and flat) are compared. Tests are repeated at different camera to object distances to investigate distance dependent induced errors and assess the accuracy of the photogrammetrically derived models. An extensive statistical analysis of the different systems is performed and comparisons against reference control point measured through a high precision underwater geodetic network are reported.},

abstract = {Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) are an affordable, effective complement to existing coral reef monitoring and assessment tools. sUAS provide repeat-able low-altitude, high-resolution photogrammetry to address fundamental questions of spatial ecology and community dynamics for shallow coral reef ecosystems. Here, we qualitatively describe the use of sUAS to survey the spatial characteristics of coral cover and the distribution of coral bleaching across patch reefs in Ka ¯ne'ohe Bay, Hawaii, and address limitations and anticipated technology advancements within the field of UAS. Overlapping sub-decimeter low-altitude aerial reef imagery collected during the 2015 coral bleaching event was used to construct high-resolution reef image mosaics of coral bleaching responses on four Ka ¯ne'ohe Bay patch reefs, totaling 60,000 m 2 . Using sUAS imagery, we determined that paled, bleached and healthy corals on all four reefs were spatially clustered. Comparative analyses of data from sUAS imagery and in situ diver surveys found as much as 14{\%} difference in coral cover values between survey methods, depending on the size of the reef and area surveyed. When comparing the abundance of unhealthy coral (paled and bleached) between sUAS and in situ diver surveys, we found differ-ences in cover from 1 to 49{\%}, depending on the depth of in situ surveys, the percent of reef area covered with sUAS surveys and patchiness of the bleaching response. This study demonstrates the effective use of sUAS surveys for assessing the spatial dynamics of coral bleaching at colony-scale resolutions across entire patch reefs and evaluates the complementarity of data from both sUAS and in situ diver surveys to more accurately characterize the spatial ecology of coral communities on reef flats and slopes.},

abstract = {Animal forests promote marine habitats morphological complexity and functioning. The red gorgonian, Paramuricea clavata, is a key structuring species of the Mediterranean coralligenous habitat and an indicator species of climate effects on habitat functioning. P. clavata metrics such as population structure, morphology and biomass inform on the overall health of coralligenous habitats, but the estimation of these metrics is time and cost consuming, and often requires destructive sampling. As a consequence, the implementation of long-term and wide-area monitoring programmes is limited. This study proposes a novel and transferable Structure from Motion (SfM) based method for the estimation of gorgonian population structure (i.e., maximal height, density, abundance), morphometries (i.e., maximal width, fan surface) and biomass (i.e., coenenchymal Dry Weight, Ash Free Dried Weight). The method includes the estimation of a novel metric (3D canopy surface) describing the gorgonian forest as a mosaic of planes generated by fitting multiple 5 cm × 5 cm facets to a SfM generated point cloud. The performance of the method is assessed for two different cameras (GoPro Hero4 and Sony NEX7). Results showed that for highly dense populations (17 colonies/m2), the SfM-method had lower accuracies in estimating the gorgonians density for both cameras (60{\%} to 89{\%}) than for medium to low density populations (14 and 7 colonies/m2) (71{\%} to 100{\%}). Results for the validation of the method showed that the correlation between ground truth and SfM estimates for maximal height, maximal width and fan surface were between R2 = 0.63 and R2 = 0.9, and R2 = 0.99 for coenenchymal surface estimation. The methodological approach was used to estimate the biomass of the gorgonian population within the study area and across the coralligenous habitat between −25 to −40 m depth in the Portofino Marine Protected Area. For that purpose, the coenenchymal surface of sampled colonies was obtained and used for the calculations. Results showed biomass values of dry weight and ash free dry weight of 220 g and 32 g for the studied area and to 365 kg and 55 Kg for the coralligenous habitat in the Marine Protected Area. This study highlighted the feasibility of the methodology for the quantification of P. clavata metrics as well as the potential of the SfM-method to improve current predictions of the status of the coralligenous habitat in the Mediterranean sea and overall management of threatened ecosystems.},

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly employed to take measurements for environ- mental monitoring, but planning informative, measurement-rich paths through large three- dimensional (3D) environments is still challenging. The problem of planning such paths is known as the informative path planning (IPP) problem, and has been shown to be non- deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard. Existing algorithms focus on providing guaran- tees on suboptimal solutions, but do not scale well to large problem instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel IPP algorithm that uses an evolutionary strategy (ES) technique to optimize a parametrized path in continuous space, which is subject to various constraints regarding path budgets and motion capabilities of an autonomous mobile robot. Moreover, we introduce a replanning scheme to adapt the planned paths according to information gained from measurements taken in situ during a data collection mission. When compared to opti- mal paths on discrete graphs, our method provides competitive results at significantly lower computation times and memory requirements. Our results show that planning in continuous space can provide solutions which outperform the optimum on a discrete graph. The proposed replanning scheme enables to build models with up to 25{\{}{\%}{\}} lower uncertainty within an (initially unknown) areas of interest. After presenting theoretical results, we tailored the proposed algorithms for data collection using an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) within the context of an ecological study, during which the method was validated through three field deployments on Lake Zurich, Switzerland. Spatiotemporal variations are shown over a period of three months and an area of 350 m × 350 m × 13 m. Whereas our theoretical solution can be applied to multiple applications, our field results specifically highlight the effectiveness of our planner for monitoring toxic cyanobacteria populations in a pre-alpine lake, and for identifying hot-spots within the cyanobacterial distribution.},

abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can be used for sampling our lakes and oceans to measure temperature, Chlorophyll abundance, or other physical properties of the water. A commonly proposed method for collecting informative data in robotics is informative sampling or informative path planning. In informative sampling, information-theoretic metrics are used on top of a created model to decide where to deploy sensors or robots. If a model of the environment is already available, this can be done off-line. Alternatively a model can be learned and optimized for on-line, in adaptive informative sampling (AIS). In this paper we report on field trials where we assess the feasibility of running AIS on board a commercial-off-the-shelf AUV. We propose a method of quantifying AIS field performance by using bathymetric data. We show that it is possible to create a Gaussian Process model on board a small commercial-off-the-shelf AUV, and to use this model to determine waypoints for sampling. Our field results show similar performance curves between full and half duration runs, resulting in good models of bathymetry and Chlorophyll fields.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. In this paper we present a novel information-theoretic utility function for selecting actions in a robot-based autonomous exploration task. The robot's goal in an autonomous exploration task is to create a complete, high-quality map of an unknown environment as quickly as possible. This implicitly requires the robot to maintain an accurate estimate of its pose as it explores both unknown and previously observed terrain in order to correctly incorporate new information into the map. Our utility function simultaneously considers uncertainty in both the robot pose and the map in a novel way and is computed as the difference between the Shannon and the R{\'{e}}nyi entropy of the current distribution over maps. R{\'{e}}nyi's entropy is a family of functions parameterized by a scalar, with Shannon's entropy being the limit as this scalar approaches unity. We link the value of this scalar parameter to the predicted future uncertainty in the robot's pose after taking an exploratory action. This effectively decreases the expected information gain of the action, with higher uncertainty in the robot's pose leading to a smaller expected information gain. Our objective function allows the robot to automatically trade off between exploration and exploitation in a way that does not require manually tuning parameter values, a significant advantage over many competing methods that only use Shannon's definition of entropy. We use simulated experiments to compare the performance of our proposed utility function to these state-of-the-art utility functions. We show that robots that use our proposed utility function generate maps with less uncertainty and fewer visible artifacts and that the robots have less uncertainty in their pose during exploration. Finally, we demonstrate that a real-world robot using our proposed ut ility function is able to successfully create a high-quality map of an indoor office environment.},

In adaptive IPP, the robot chooses the next sensing location conditioned on all information acquired so far, and the robot's goal is to minimize the travel cost required for identifying a true hypothesis. Adaptive IPP is NP-hard, because the robot must trade-off information gain and travel cost optimally. In this paper we present Recursive Adaptive Identification (RAId), a new polynomial-time approximation algorithm for adaptive IPP. We prove a polylogarithmic approximation bound when the robot travels in a metric space. Furthermore, our experiments suggest that RAId is practical and provides good approximate solutions for two distinct robot planning tasks. Although RAId is designed primarily for noiseless observations, a simple extension allows it to handle some tasks with noisy observations.},

Abstract Large repositories of 3D shapes provide valuable input for data-driven analysis and modeling tools. They are especially powerful once annotated with semantic information such as salient regions and functional parts. We propose a novel active learning method capable of enriching massive geometric datasets with accurate se-mantic region annotations. Given a shape collection and a user-specified region label our goal is to correctly demarcate the corre-sponding regions with minimal manual work. Our active frame-work achieves this goal by cycling between manually annotating the regions, automatically propagating these annotations across the rest of the shapes, manually verifying both human and automatic annotations, and learning from the verification results to improve the automatic propagation algorithm. We use a unified utility func-tion that explicitly models the time cost of human input across all steps of our method. This allows us to jointly optimize for the set of models to annotate and for the set of models to verify based on the predicted impact of these actions on the human effi-ciency. We demonstrate that incorporating verification of all pro-duced labelings within this unified objective improves both accu-racy and efficiency of the active learning procedure. We automati-cally propagate human labels across a dynamic shape network us-ing a conditional random field (CRF) framework, taking advantage of global shape-to-shape similarities, local feature similarities, and point-to-point correspondences. By combining these diverse cues we achieve higher accuracy than existing alternatives. We validate our framework on existing benchmarks demonstrating it to be sig-nificantly more efficient at using human input compared to previous techniques. We further validate its efficiency and robustness by an-notating a massive shape dataset, labeling over 93,000 shape parts, across multiple model classes, and providing a labeled part collec-tion more than one order of magnitude larger than existing ones.},

To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.},

abstract = {Techniques that jointly perform dense 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation have recently shown very promising results. One major restriction so far is that they can often only handle a very low number of semantic labels. This is mostly due to their high memory consumption caused by the necessity to store indicator variables for every label and transition. We propose a way to reduce the memory consumption of existing methods. Our approach is based on the observation that many semantic labels are only present at very localized positions in the scene, such as cars. Therefore this label does not need to be active at every location. We exploit this observation by dividing the scene into blocks in which generally only a subset of labels is active. By determining early on in the reconstruction process which labels need to be active in which block the memory consumption can be significantly reduced. In order to recover from mistakes we propose to update the set of active labels during the iterative optimization procedure based on the current solution. We also propose a way to initialize the set of active labels using a boosted classifier. In our experimental evaluation we show the reduction of memory usage quantitatively. Eventually, we show results of joint semantic 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation with significantly more labels than previous approaches were able to handle.},

Our approach is especially well-adapted for estimating local shape properties such as normals (both unoriented and oriented) and curvature from raw point clouds in the presence of strong noise and multi-scale features. Our main contributions include both a novel multi-scale variant of the recently proposed PointNet architecture with emphasis on local shape information, and a series of novel applications in which we demonstrate how learning from training data arising from well-structured triangle meshes, and applying the trained model to noisy point clouds can produce superior results compared to specialized state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach in the context of shape reconstruction, by showing how it can be used to extract normal orientation information from point clouds.},

Direct semantic segmentation of unstructured 3D point clouds is still an open research problem. The recently proposed PointNet architecture presents an interesting step ahead in that it can operate on unstructured point clouds, achieving encouraging segmentation results.

In this paper, we investigate the question how such an architecture can be extended to incorporate larger-scale spatial context. We build upon PointNet and propose two extensions that enlarge the receptive field over the 3D scene. We evaluate the proposed strategies on challenging indoor and outdoor datasets and show improved results in both scenarios.},

abstract = {Modern datasets and models are notoriously difficult to explore and analyze due to their inherent high dimensionality and massive numbers of samples. Existing visualization methods which employ dimensionality reduction to two or three dimensions are often inefficient and/or ineffective for these datasets. This paper introduces t-SNE-CUDA, a GPU-accelerated implementation of t-distributed Symmetric Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for visualizing datasets and models. t-SNE-CUDA significantly outperforms current implementations with 50-700x speedups on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. These speedups enable, for the first time, visualization of the neural network activations on the entire ImageNet dataset - a feat that was previously computationally intractable. We also demonstrate visualization performance in the NLP domain by visualizing the GloVe embedding vectors. From these visualizations, we can draw interesting conclusions about using the L2 metric in these embedding spaces. t-SNE-CUDA is publicly available athttps://github.com/CannyLab/tsne-cuda},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose PointRCNN for 3D object detection from raw point cloud. The whole framework is composed of two stages: stage-1 for the bottom-up 3D proposal generation and stage-2 for refining proposals in the canonical coordinates to obtain the final detection results. Instead of generating proposals from RGB image or projecting point cloud to bird's view or voxels as previous methods do, our stage-1 sub-network directly generates a small number of high-quality 3D proposals from point cloud in a bottom-up manner via segmenting the point cloud of the whole scene into foreground points and background. The stage-2 sub-network transforms the pooled points of each proposal to canonical coordinates to learn better local spatial features, which is combined with global semantic features of each point learned in stage-1 for accurate box refinement and confidence prediction. Extensive experiments on the 3D detection benchmark of KITTI dataset show that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods with remarkable margins by using only point cloud as input.

Locating the hotspots of such sparsely distributed phenomena is often difficult because their density gradient is likely to be very noisy. We present a novel approach to this search problem, where we model the co-occurrence relations between a robot's observations with a Bayesian nonparametric topic model. This approach makes it possible to produce a robust estimate of the spatial distribution of the target, even in the absence of direct target observations. We apply the proposed approach to the problem of finding the spatial locations of the hotspots of a specific phytoplankton taxon in the ocean. We use classified image data from Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), which automatically measures individual microscopic cells and colonies of cells. Given these individual taxon-specific observations, we learn a phytoplankton community model that characterizes the co-occurrence relations between taxa. We present experiments with simulated robot missions drawn from real observation data collected during a research cruise traversing the US Atlantic coast. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms nearest neighbor and k-means based methods for predicting the spatial distribution of hotspots from in-situ observations.},

Whereas feature based scene recognition and pose estimation methods are well established as effective means for estimating motion and recognizing locations, feature-based methods depend critically on the detection of common local features from one view of a scene to another. We focus on place recognition and pose change estimation in the context of large changes in viewing position, even to the extent that no common surfaces are seen between the two views. Our approach is based on using object identities and their inter-relationship to compute pose change. An important secondary outcome of our method is that it simultaneously infers the 3D poses of objects in the scene that are used as features. Such an object-based approach is inspired by a vast literature on human perception and has the potential for great robustness, albeit at the expense of accuracy. We propose a formulation of the problem using pairwise contextual constraints and develop an efficient algorithmic solution.

abstract = {We address the problem of learning vision-based, collision-avoiding, and target-selecting controllers in 3D, specifically in underwater environments densely populated with coral reefs. Using a highly maneuverable, dynamic, six-legged (or flippered) vehicle to swim underwater, we exploit real time visual feedback to make close-range navigation decisions that would be hard to achieve with other sensors. Our approach uses computer vision as the sole mechanism for both collision avoidance and visual target selection. In particular, we seek to swim close to the reef to make observations while avoiding both collisions and barren, coral-deprived regions. To carry out path selection while avoiding collisions, we use monocular image data processed in real time. The proposed system uses a convolutional neural network that takes an image from a forward-facing camera as input and predicts unscaled and relative path changes. The network is trained to encode our desired obstacle-avoidance and reef-exploration objectives via supervised learning from human-labeled data. The predictions from the network are transformed into absolute path changes via a combination of a temporally-smoothed proportional controller for heading targets and a low-level motor controller. This system enables safe and autonomous coral reef navigation in underwater environments. We validate our approach using an untethered and fully autonomous robot swimming through coral reef in the open ocean. Our robot successfully traverses 1000 m of the ocean floor collision-free while collecting close-up footage of coral reefs.},

Our approach assumes that the trajectories described by the source robot are feasible on the target robot. By making this assumption, we only need to learn a mapping from the source robot state and action spaces to the target robot action space, which we call a policy adjustment model. We demonstrate our approach in simulation in the cart-pole balancing task and a two link double pendulum.

We propose a novel combination of deep-learning-based object features and state-of-the-art SIFT point-features that yields improved robustness to scale change.

We evaluate the proposed technique on the KITTI Odometry benchmark and on a novel dataset of outdoor images exhibiting changes in visual scale of {\$}7\backslashtimes{\$} and greater, which we have released to the public. Our technique consistently outperforms localization using either SIFT features or the proposed object features alone, achieving both greater accuracy and much lower failure rates under large changes in scale.},

We follow the approach of tracking-by-detection, which combines the robust, drift-free nature of object detection with the temporal consistency of tracking algorithms. Central to our method is a multi-output convolutional network that jointly predicts whether the target robot is present in the image (classification), the 2D bounding box around the target in the image plane, and the 3D orientation of the target. This, combined with camera intrinsic parameters and prior knowledge of the robot's absolute scale, allows us to recover the full 6-degree-of-freedom pose (translation and orientation) of the target robot. To train our network, we use only synthetic images rendered using the Unreal game engine, which is a cost-effective way to produce a large training set without the need for laborious manual annotations. Our evaluation analyzes the impact of orientation offset on 3D detection accuracy, and demonstrates successful generalization of the learned model to real underwater photographs of the target robot.},

Our application in this paper is to cover a region of the sea surface using a robotic boat, although the algorithmic approach has wider applicability. We propose an anytime planning technique for efficient data gath- ering using point-sampling based on non-uniform data-driven coverage. Our goal is to sense a particular region of interest in the environment and be able to reconstruct the measured spatial field. Since there are autonomous agents involved, there is a need to consider the costs involved in terms of energy consumed and time required to finish the task. An ideal map of the scalar field requires complete coverage of the region, but can be approximated by a good sparse coverage strategy along with an efficient interpolation technique. We propose to optimize the trade off between the environmental field mapping and the costs (energy consumed, time spent, and distance traveled) associated with sensing. We present an anytime algorithm for sampling the environment adaptively by following a multi-scale path to produce a variable resolution map of the spatial field. We compare our approach to a traditional exhaustive survey approach and show that we are able to effectively represent a spatial field spending minimum energy. We present results that indicate our sampling technique gathering most informative samples with least travel.

In this paper, we present a search algorithm that generates efficient trajectories that optimize the rate at which probability mass is covered by a searcher. This should allow an autonomous vehicle find one or more lost targets as rapidly as possible. We do this by performing non-uniform sampling of the search region. The path generated minimizes the expected time to locate the missing target by visiting high probability regions using non-myopic path generation based on reinforcement learning. We model the target probability distribution using a classic mixture of Gaussians model with means and mixture coefficients tuned according to the location and time of sightings of the lost target. Key features of our search algorithm are the ability to employ a very general non-deterministic action model and the ability to generate action plans for any new probability distribution using the parameters learned on other similar looking distributions. One of the key contributions of this paper is the use of non-uniform state aggregation for policy search in the context of robotics. We compare the paths generated by our algorithm with other accepted spatial coverage techniques such as distribution independent boustrophedonic coverage and model dependent spiral search. We present a proof showing that rewarding for clearing probability mass instead of locating the target does not bias the objective function. The experiments show that the learned policy outperforms several well-known baselines even in scenarios different from the one it has been trained on.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.In this paper we present an efficient method for visual mapping of open water environments using exploration and reward identification followed by selective visual coverage. In particular, we consider the problem of visual mapping a shallow water coral reef to provide an environmental assay. Our approach has two stages based on two classes of sensors: bathymetric mapping and visual mapping. We use a robotic boat to collect bathymetric data using a sonar sensor for the first stage and video data using a visual sensor for the second stage. Since underwater environments have varying visibility, we use the sonar map to select regions of potential value, and efficiently construct the bathymetric map from sparse data using a Gaussian Process model. In the second stage, we collect visual data only where there is good potential pay-off, and we use a reward-driven finite-horizon model akin to a Markov Decision Process to extract the maximum amount of valuable data in the least amount of time.

Image analysis using a (RBF‐SVM) radial basis function‐support vector machines in combination with (LBP) local binary pattern, Gabor and Hue descriptors developed in this work are able to analyze the resulting image data automatically and reliably by learning from the annotations of expert marine biologists. Our primary evaluation is performed on a novel coral data set that we collected during a series of robotic ocean deployments, the MRL Coral Identification Challenge. We have also applied our algorithms to a data set of coral imagery previously published by other researchers. Our algorithms recognize coral images in our own challenging data with 88.9{\%} accuracy, while being sufficiently efficient to run online on our vehicle. This demonstrates the feasibility of such a system for practical use for the preservation of this crucial ecological resource.},

abstract = {We propose a system for visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that combines traditional local appearance-based features with semantically meaningful object landmarks to achieve both accurate local tracking and highly view-invariant object-driven relocalization. Our mapping process uses a sampling-based approach to efficiently infer the 3D pose of object landmarks from 2D bounding box object detections. These 3D landmarks then serve as a view-invariant representation which we leverage to achieve camera relocaliza-tion even when the viewing angle changes by more than 125 degrees. This level of view-invariance cannot be attained by local appearance-based features (e.g. SIFT) since the same set of surfaces are not even visible when the viewpoint changes significantly. Our experiments show that even when existing methods fail completely for viewpoint changes of more than 70 degrees, our method continues to achieve a relocalization rate of around 90{\%}, with a mean rotational error of around 8 degrees.},

abstract = {— In this paper we address the integrated prediction, planning, and control problem that enables a single follower robot (the " photographer ") to quickly re-establish visual con-tact with a moving target (the " subject ") that has escaped the follower's field of view. Our work addresses this unavoidable scenario, which reactive controllers are typically ill-equipped to handle, by making intelligent predictions about the long-and short-term behavior of the target, and planning pursuit paths that will maximize the chance of seeing the target again. At the core of our pursuit method is the use of predictive models of target behavior, which help narrow down the possible future locations of the target to a few discrete hypotheses, as well as the use of combinatorial search in physical space to check those hypotheses efficiently. We model target behavior in terms of a learned navigation reward function, using Inverse Reinforcement Learning, based on semantic terrain features of satellite maps. Our pursuit algorithm continuously predicts the latent destination of the target, and its position in the future, and relies on efficient graph representation and search methods in order to navigate to location hypotheses at which the target is most likely to be seen at an anticipated time. We perform extensive evaluation of our predictive pursuit algorithm over multiple satellite maps, under thousands of simulation scenarios, against state-of-the art MDP and POMDP solvers, and we show that our method significantly outperforms them by exploiting domain-specific knowledge, while being able to run in real-time. I. INTRODUCTION This paper proposes a model-based predictive pursuit algorithm that enables a robot photographer to maintain visual contact with a subject, whose motion is independent of the photographer. We explicitly address the case where visual contact is lost, and propose an algorithm that aims to minimize the expected time to recover it. This is novel with respect to previous work, particularly pursuit-evasion games, which do not consider the scenario of intermittent loss of visibility, which is inevitable in practice 1 . We make use of previous examples of navigation examples of the target, which we exploit via Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in order to estimate a reward function that expresses its preferences over the terrain features of the map. For example, the target might prefer to take paved roads, as opposed to grass or sand, in order to navigate to its destination. We can integrate that information in a behavior model for more accurate predictions, thus},

open-sea exploration. However, the mapping or inspection of complex
underwater structures, which have an interest from the scientific and
the industrial point of view, is still carried out by professional
divers or remotely operated vehicles. We propose a probabilistic
next-best-view planner, targeted to hover-capable AUVs, that will allow
them to explore these complex environments without an a priori model.
The proposed method is based on scanning the area from different
viewpoints in an iterative way. At each step, a viewpoint is chosen from
a set of random samples according to a utility function. An
obstacle-free path to the selected viewpoint is planned, and the vehicle
navigates to it to gather a new scan that will be registered with the
previous ones. To evaluate the proposed method, we present four
different tests using the Girona 500 AUV, both in simulation and in real
scenarios. The results demonstrate the capability to explore complex
environments autonomously, producing models of the environment with a
high degree of coverage that can enable mapping and inspection
applications.},

abstract = {Underwater photogrammetry has been increasingly used to study and monitor the three-dimensional characteristics of marine habitats, despite a lack of knowledge on the quality and reliability of the reconstructions. More particularly, little attention has been paid to exploring and estimating the relative contribution of multiple acquisition parameters on the model resolution (distance between neighbour vertices), accuracy (closeness to true positions / measures) and precision (variability of positions / measures). On the other hand, some studies used expensive or cumbersome camera systems that can restrict the number of users of this technology for the monitoring of marine habitats. This study aimed at developing a simple and cost-effective protocol able to produce accurate and reproducible high-resolution models. Precisely, the effects of the camera system, flying elevation, camera orientation and number of images on the resolution and accuracy of marine habitat reconstructions was tested through two experiments. A first experiment allowed for testing all combinations of acquisition parameters through the building of 192 models of the same 36 m² study site. The flying elevation and camera system strongly affected the model resolution, while the photo density mostly affected bundle adjustment accuracy and total processing time. The camera orientation, in turn, mostly affected the reprojection error. The best combination of parameters was used in a second experiment to assess the accuracy and precision of the resulting reconstructions. The average model resolution was 3.4 mm, and despite a decreasing precision in the positioning of markers with distance to the model centre (0.33, 0.27 and 1.2 mm / m Standard Deviation (SD) in X, Y, Z, respectively), the measures were very accurate and precise: 0.08 {\%} error ± 0.06 SD for bar lengths, 0.36 {\%} ± 0.51 SD for a rock model area and 0.92 {\%} ± 0.54 SD for its volume. The 3D geometry of the rock only differed by 1.2 mm ± 0.8 SD from the ultra-high resolution in-air reference. These results suggest that this simple and cost-effective protocol produces accurate and reproducible models that are suitable for the study and monitoring of marine habitats at a small reef scale.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd. Marine ecosystems provide critically important goods and services to society, and hence their accelerated degradation underpins an urgent need to take rapid, ambitious and informed decisions regarding their conservation and management.The capacity, however, to generate the detailed field data required to inform conservation planning at appropriate scales is limited by time and resource consuming methods for collecting and analysing field data at the large scales required.The 'Catlin Seaview Survey', described here, introduces a novel framework for large-scale monitoring of coral reefs using high-definition underwater imagery collected using customized underwater vehicles in combination with computer vision and machine learning. This enables quantitative and geo-referenced outputs of coral reef features such as habitat types, benthic composition, and structural complexity (rugosity) to be generated across multiple kilometre-scale transects with a spatial resolution ranging from 2 to 6m2.The novel application of technology described here has enormous potential to contribute to our understanding of coral reefs and associated impacts by underpinning management decisions with kilometre-scale measurements of reef health.Imagery datasets from an initial survey of 500km of seascape are freely available through an online tool called the Catlin Global Reef Record. Outputs from the image analysis using the technologies described here will be updated on the online repository as work progresses on each dataset.Case studies illustrate the utility of outputs as well as their potential to link to information from remote sensing. The potential implications of the innovative technologies on marine resource management and conservation are also discussed, along with the accuracy and efficiency of the methodologies deployed.},

This approach is explored in the context of lunar application to enhance robotic modeling. Experimentation on simulated data and in artificial lunar terrain at aerial and ground rover scales is documented. Results show up to 40{\%} improvement in MSE reconstruction error.

To drive near pedestrians safely, efficiently, and smoothly, autonomous vehicles must estimate unknown pedes- trian intentions and hedge against the uncertainty in intention estimates in order to choose actions that are effective and robust. A key feature of our approach is to use the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for systematic, robust decision making under uncertainty. Although there are concerns about the potentially high computational complexity of POMDP planning, experiments show that our POMDP- based planner runs in near real time, at 3 Hz, on a robot golf cart in a complex, dynamic environment. This indicates that POMDP planning is improving fast in computational efficiency and becoming increasingly practical as a tool for robot planning under uncertainty.},

abstract = {Classifying objects in complex unknown environments is a challenging problem in robotics and is fundamental in many applications. Modern sensors and sophisticated perception algorithms extract rich 3D textured information, but are limited to the data that are collected from a given location or path. We are interested in closing the loop around perception and planning, in particular to plan paths for better perceptual data, and focus on the problem of planning scanning sequences to improve object classification from range data. We formulate a novel time-constrained active classification problem and propose solution algorithms that employ a variation of Monte Carlo tree search to plan non-myopically. Our algorithms use a particle filter combined with Gaussian process regression to estimate joint distributions of object class and pose. This estimator is used in planning to generate a probabilistic belief about the state of objects in a scene, and also to generate beliefs for predicted sensor observations from future viewpoints. These predictions consider occlu-This is one of several papers published in Autonomous Robots comprising the Special Issue on Active Perception.

We evaluate our algorithms in simulation, in comparison to passive and greedy strategies. We also describe similar experiments where the algorithms are implemented online, using a mobile ground robot in a farm environment. Results indicate that our non-myopic approach outperforms both passive and myopic strategies, and clearly show the benefit of active perception for outdoor object classification.},

abstract = {Caves on other planetary bodies offer sheltered habitat for future human explorers and numerous clues to a planet's past for scientists. While recent orbital imagery provides exciting new details about cave entrances on the Moon and Mars, the interiors of these caves are still unknown and not observable from orbit. Multi-robot teams offer unique solutions for exploration and modeling subsurface voids during precursor missions. Robot teams that are diverse in terms of size, mobility, sensing, and capability can provide great advantages, but this diversity, coupled with inherently distinct low-level behavior architectures, makes coordination a challenge. This paper presents a framework that consists of an autonomous frontier and capability-based task generator, a distributed market-based strategy for coordinating and allocating tasks to the different team members, and a communication paradigm for seamless interaction between the different robots in the system. Robots have different sensors, (in the representative robot team used for testing: 2D mapping sensors, 3D modeling sensors, or no exteroceptive sensors), and varying levels of mobility. Tasks are generated to explore, model, and take science samples. Based on an individual robot's capability and associated cost for executing a generated task, a robot is autonomously selected for task execution. The robots create coarse online maps and store collected data for high resolution offline modeling. The coordination approach has been field tested at a mock cave site with highly-unstructured natural terrain, as well as an outdoor patio area. Initial results are promising for applicability of the proposed multi-robot framework to exploration and modeling of planetary caves.},

We pursue an active perception strategy that enables MAVs with limited onboard sensing and processing capabilities to concurrently assess feasible rooftop landing sites with a vision-based perception system while generating trajectories that balance continued landing site assessment and the requirement to provide visual monitoring of an interest point. The contributions of the work are twofold: (1) a perception system that employs a dense motion stereo approach that determines the 3D model of the captured scene without the need of geo-referenced images, scene geometry constraints, or external navigation aids; and (2) an online trajectory generation approach that balances the need to concurrently explore available rooftop vantages of an interest point while ensuring confidence in the landing site suitability by considering the impact of landing site uncertainty as assessed by the perception system. Simulation and experimental evaluation of the performance of the perception and trajectory generation methodologies are analyzed independently and jointly in order to establish the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature We propose a self-organising map (SOM) algorithm as a solution to a new multi-goal path planning problem for active perception and data collection tasks. We optimise paths for a multi-robot team that aims to maximally observe a set of nodes in the environment. The selected nodes are observed by visiting associated viewpoint regions defined by a sensor model. The key problem characteristics are that the viewpoint regions are overlapping polygonal continuous regions, each node has an observation reward, and the robots are constrained by travel budgets. The SOM algorithm jointly selects and allocates nodes to the robots and finds favourable sequences of sensing locations. The algorithm has a runtime complexity that is polynomial in the number of nodes to be observed and the magnitude of the relative weighting of rewards. We show empirically the runtime is sublinear in the number of robots. We demonstrate feasibility for the active perception task of observing a set of 3D objects. The viewpoint regions consider sensing ranges and self-occlusions, and the rewards are measured as discriminability in the ensemble of shape functions feature space. Exploration objectives for online tasks where the environment is only partially known in advance are modelled by introducing goal regions in unexplored space. Online replanning is performed efficiently by adapting previous solutions as new information becomes available. Simulations were performed using a 3D point-cloud dataset from a real robot in a large outdoor environment. Our results show the proposed methods enable multi-robot planning for online active perception tasks with continuous sets of candidate viewpoints and long planning horizons.},

abstract = {Impacts of extreme Barents Sea air-sea exchanges are examined using the HadCM3 coupled ocean-atmosphere model. Variability in the Barents Sea winter air-sea density flux is found to be a potentially significant factor in determining changes in the southward transport of dense water through Fram Strait. The density flux variability is primarily driven by the thermal term, FT, due to heat loss to the atmosphere. The other two terms (haline flux and ice formation) play a relatively minor role. The difference in ocean circulation between winters with extreme strong and weak Barents Sea surface density flux anomalies is analyzed. This reveals an increase in strong winters of both the north-westward intermediate depth flow out of the basin and the east-west deep flows north of Spitsbergen and south through the Fram Strait. A linear fit yields a Fram Strait southward transport increase of 1.22 Sv for an increase in FT of 1 3 1026 kgm22 s21. For the 10 strongest Barents Sea surface density flux winters, the Fram Strait winter southward transport increases by 2.4 Sv. This compares with a reduction of 1.0 Sv for the corresponding weakest winters. Furthermore, the properties of the southward flowing water are modified in strong density flux winters. In such winters, the Fram Strait water below 250 mis colder by up to 0.5?C and fresher by 0.05 than the climatological winter mean.},

When the system on the rover alerts the rover to take addi- tional measurements of interesting rocks, the planning and scheduling component de- termines if there are enough resources to meet this additional science data request. The rover is then instructed to either turn toward the rock, or to actually move closer to the rock to take an additional, close-up image.

Selecting suitable landing sites is fundamental to achieving many mission objectives in planetary robotic lander missions. However, due to sensing limitations, landing sites which are both safe and scientifically valuable often cannot be determined reliably from orbit, particularly, in icy moon missions where orbital sensing data is noisy and incomplete. This paper presents an active perception approach to Entry Descent and Landing (EDL) which enables the lander to autonomously plan informative descent trajectories, acquire high quality sensing data during descent and exploit this additional information to select higher utility landing sites. Our approach consists of two components: probabilistic modeling of landing site features and approximate trajectory planning using a sampling based planner. The proposed framework allows the lander to plan long horizons paths and remain robust to noisy data. Results in simulated environments show large performance improvements over alternative approaches and show promise that our approach has strong potential to improve science return of not only icy moon missions but EDL systems in general.},

However, energy and time constraints limit how often these sensors can be used in a mission. Robots are also equipped with cheaper to use navigation sensors such as cameras. In this paper, we explore a challenging planning problem in which a robot is required to learn about a scientific variable of interest in an initially unknown environment by planning informative paths and deciding when and where to use its sensors. To tackle this we present two innovations: a Bayesian generative model framework to automatically learn correlations between expensive science sensors and cheaper to use navigation sensors online, and a sampling based approach to plan for multiple sensors while handling long horizons and budget constraints. Our approach does not grow in complexity with data and is anytime making it highly applicable to field robotics. We tested our approach extensively in simulation and validated it with real data collected during the 2014 Mojave Volatiles Prospector Mission.

abstract = {Marine phenomena such as algal blooms can be detected using in situ measurements onboard autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), but understanding plankton ecology and community structure requires retrieval and analysis of water specimens. This process requires shipboard or manual sample collection, followed by onshore lab analysis which is time-consuming. Better understanding of the relationship between the observable environmental features and organism abundance would allow more precisely targeted sampling and thereby save time. In this work, we present an approach to learn and improve models that predict this relationship. Coupled with recent advances in AUV technology allowing selective retrieval of water samples, this constitutes a new paradigm in biological sampling. We use organism abundance models along with spatial models of environmental features learned immediately after AUV deployments to compute spatial distributions of organisms in the coastal ocean purely from in situ AUV data. We use Gaussian process regression along with the unscented transform to fuse the two models, obtaining both the mean and variance of the organism abundance estimates. The uncertainty in organism abundance predictions is used in a sampling strategy to selectively acquire new water specimens that improves the organism abundance models. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the advantage of performing hierarchical probabilistic regression. After the validation through simulation, we show predictions of organism abundance from models learned on lab-analyzed water sample data, and AUV survey data.},

abstract = {Autonomous science augments the capabilities of planetary rovers by shifting the identification and selection of science targets from remote operators to the rover itself. This shift frees the rover from wasteful idle time and allows for more selective data collection. This paper presents an approach to autonomous science that is comprised of three components: a Bayesian network that uses image data to identify features; an evaluation algorithm that selects the best features; and, a path-planning algorithm that guides the rover to the most scientifically valuable features. Within this framework, the effectiveness of pairing a larger prime rover with a smaller scout rover to improve autonomous science is investigated. Laboratory-based experiments were used to validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian network for feature identification and the scoring algorithm that has been developed for feature evaluation. Simulations were used to compare the traditional use of a solo prime rover to that of also employing a scout. The results presented here indicate that the inclusion of a scout rover can allow the prime rover to avoid pitfalls or routes with low scientific value. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent a new frontier in a wide range of monitoring and research applications. To fully leverage their potential, a key challenge is planning missions for efficient data acquisition in complex environments. To address this issue, this article introduces a general informative path planning (IPP) framework for monitoring scenarios using an aerial robot. The approach is capable of mapping either discrete or continuous target variables on a terrain using variable-resolution data received from probabilistic sensors. During a mission, the terrain maps built online are used to plan information-rich trajectories in continuous 3-D space by optimizing initial solutions obtained by a course grid search. Extensive simulations show that our approach is more efficient than existing methods. We also demonstrate its real-time application on a photorealistic mapping scenario using a publicly available dataset.},

abstract = {In the last decades, in order to make the processing of a scene more efficient, biologically inspired approaches have been proposed. Visual attention models are being studied and actively developed in order to reduce the complexity and computational time of the existing methods. We propose a biologically inspired model that combines a single pre-trained CNN architecture with an artificial foveal visual system that performs simultaneously the classification and localization of objects in images. This model is based on the fact that only a small part of the image is processed with high resolution at each time so we load a foveated image in the network and successively employ feed-forward passes to determine the class labels and then via backward propagation determine the object possible locations according to each semantic label. By directing the attention to the center of the proposed location we mimic the human saccadic eye movements. In the results obtained we used the ILSVRC 2012 validation data set in a GoogLeNet CNN. We demonstrate that for non-centered objects the gain of the classification performance between iterations is significant showing that when mimicking the human visual behaviour of foveation, saccades are needed to integrate the information at each time.},

This problem arises in a diverse range of scenarios, such as autonomous underwater vehicles supervised by surface vessels, pedestrians monitored by aerial vehicles, and animals monitored by agricultural robots. The key problem characteristics we consider are that the monitor must remain stationary while observing the robot, robot motion is modeled in general as a stochastic process, and observations are modeled as a spatial probability distribution. We propose a resolution-complete algorithm that runs in a polynomial time. The algorithm is based on a sweep-plane approach and generates a motion plan that maximizes the expected observation time and value. A variety of stochastic models may be used to represent the robot trajectory. We present results with data drawn from real AUV missions, a real pedestrian trajectory dataset and Monte Carlo simulations.

abstract = {Robots such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have been used for sensing and monitoring aquatic environments such as oceans and lakes. Environmental sampling is a challenging task because the environmental attributes to be observed can vary both spatially and temporally, and the target environment is usually a large and continuous domain whereas the sampling data is typically sparse and limited. The challenges require that the sampling method must be informative and efficient enough to catch up with the environmental dynamics. In this paper we present a planning and learning method that enables a sampling robot to perform persistent monitoring tasks by learning and refining a dynamic "data map" that models a spatiotemporal environment attribute such as ocean salinity content. Our environmental sampling framework consists of two components: to maximize the information collected, we propose an informative planning component that efficiently generates sampling waypoints that contain the maximal information; To alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data accumulated, we develop a component based on a sparse Gaussian Process whose hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data that provides the greatest contribution. We validate our method with both simulations running on real ocean data and field trials with an ASV in a lake environment. Our experiments show that the proposed framework is both accurate in learning the environmental data map and efficient in catching up with the dynamic environmental changes.},

abstract = {The Bayesian framework for machine learning allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge in a coherent way, avoids overfitting problems, and provides a principled basis for selecting between alternative models. Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a unified variational Bayesian (VB) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propagation algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the VB EM algorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential (CE) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated VB derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the VB EM algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models. It is shown how model selection tasks such as determining the dimensionality, cardinality, or number of variables are possible using VB approximations. Also explored are methods for combining sampling procedures with variational approximations, to estimate the tightness of VB bounds and to obtain more effective sampling algorithms. Chapter 6 applies VB learning to a long-standing problem of scoring discrete-variable directed acyclic graphs, and compares the performance to annealed importance sampling amongst other methods. Throughout, the VB approximation is compared to other methods including sampling, Cheeseman-Stutz, and asymptotic approximations such as BIC. The thesis concludes with a discussion of evolving directions for model selection including infinite models and alternative approximations to the marginal likelihood. 2},

abstract = {Maturing technology has allowed the reliable de- ployment of robots into large-scale environments for monitoring and exploration applications. Planning techniques which ignore the value of information gathered during transit are able to operate efficiently in these environments and generate trajecto- ries between specified starting and ending locations. Including the value of information gathered during transit increases the complexity of the problem and often leads to algorithms which are unable to scale up to large environments. This paper presents a method for planning informative surveys in large- scale unexplored environments. The proposed methodology does not require a starting or ending location as a constraint. Instead, robot operators are required to specify a survey template, which satisfies both vehicle constraints and the scientific objectives of the deployment. This constraint converts the exploration prob- lem into an experimental design problem where the objective is to choose a location for the specified survey trajectory. A functional representation of the survey utility is learnt using a Gaussian process. This model allows the utility of candidate survey placements to be queried in a continuous space and in arbitrary locations. The proposed exploration method is demonstrated and validated on marine data. The objective is to design a survey which allows the spatial distribution of habitats in a large marine environment to be estimated accurately. The results show that the proposed exploration method is able to model the hidden survey utility function successfully and recommend informative survey placements.},

abstract = {— As autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming routinely used in an exploratory context for ocean science, the goal of visually augmented navigation (VAN) is to improve the near-seafloor navigation precision of such vehicles without imposing the burden of having to deploy additional infrastructure. This is in contrast to traditional acoustic long baseline navigation techniques, which require the deployment, calibration, and eventual recovery of a transponder network. To achieve this goal, VAN is formulated within a vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework that exploits the systems-level complementary aspects of a camera and strap-down sensor suite. The result is an environmentally-based navigation technique robust to the peculiarities of low-overlap underwater imagery. The method employs a view-based representation where camera-derived relative-pose measurements provide spatial constraints, which enforce trajectory consistency and also serve as a mechanism for loop-closure, allowing for error growth to be independent of time for revisited imagery. This article outlines the multi-sensor VAN framework and demonstrates it to have compelling advantages over a purely vision-only approach by: (i) improving the robustness of low-overlap underwater image registration, (ii) setting the free gauge scale, and (iii) allowing for a disconnected camera-constraint topology.},

abstract = {The structural complexity of coral reef environments has a strong influence on the assemblage of reef-associated fishes and invertebrates. These unique ecosystems provide these reef-associated species with a broad range of potential habitats, which offer important resources such as food and shelter. The most studied habitat association on reefs is that of hard coral and fish, where hard coral cover has been found to have a large and positive influence on the assemblage of reef fishes. In contrast, soft coral has been considered poor habitat due to their chemical defences and weak body architecture. However, the empirical basis for this assumption is minimal and the ecological importance of soft corals remains controversial and unresolved. The present study closely examined fish assemblages utilising a mixed mosaic of coral reef habitats at sites ranging from hard to soft coral dominated assemblages. Fishes associated with soft coral in a variety of ways including as shelter, a source of food or a surface on which epiphytic food was sourced. Fish assemblages remained similar between soft and hard coral dominated habitats, and there was no evidence that a high percentage cover of soft coral had deleterious effects. Further, a significant increase in species richness of fishes was found with increasing soft coral cover, suggesting that the importance of soft coral habitat has been underestimated on reefs with a mosaic of different habitats. Here, we discuss the implications of these associations and suggest that soft coral provides distinct habitat for reef fishes, and future research should address their ecological importance.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are a valuable and vulnerable marine ecosystem. The structure of coral reefs influences their health and ability to fulfill ecosystem functions and services. However, monitoring reef corals largely relies on 1D or 2D estimates of coral cover and abundance that overlook change in ecologically significant aspects of the reefs because they do not incorporate vertical or volumetric information. This study explores the relationship between 2D and 3D metrics of coral size. We show that surface area and volume scale consistently with planar area, albeit with morphotype specific conversion parameters. We use a photogrammetric approach using open-source software to estimate the ability of photogrammetry to provide measurement estimates of corals in 3D. Technological developments have made photogrammetry a valid and practical technique for studying coral reefs. We anticipate that these techniques for moving coral research from 2D into 3D will facilitate answering ecological questions by incorporating the 3rd dimension into monitoring.},

The use of the SoG allows us to combine the benefits of both a Particle Filter (PF) and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach in a single filter. An Active Localization (AL) method is applied to the SoG to autonomously choose the best waypoints for autonomous convergence. Both the SoG filter and the AL are tested in a real scenario with an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) and compared with a vision-based method to confirm localization.},

abstract = {This paper presents a solution to the problem of path following control for autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) subject to input constraints and constant ocean current disturbances. We propose two nonlinear control strategies: the first is obtained by using a Lyapunov-based design method, while the second is developed by adopting a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. We show that, with the proposed control strategies, the path-following error is globally asymptotically stable (GAS). Simulations with a kinematic model of the vehicle support the theoretical results. Simulations with a realistic model of the Medusa class of AMVs show the robustness of the proposed control strategies.},

abstract = {Over the last few years there have been advances in technical diving, which have made it more accessible (including financially), making it possible to dive to greater depths and, consequently, reach underwater archaeological sites in deeper waters, which were previously considered “untouchable”. As these sites are now at potential risk of anthropic interference, new approaches to monitoring techniques are therefore considered necessary to ensure the protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. This paper presents a protocol for monitoring techniques to be applied to ‘mid-depth archaeological remains'. The proposed technique is based on a combination of low-cost photogrammetric methods. Using as a case study a Roman era shipwreck from Majorca, off the east coast of Spain, this paper presents an ideal protocol for the essential first stages in protecting and managing the archaeological record of an underwater site at medium depth. The process gives immediate results, using photogrammetric and orthophoto coverage of the site to build up a highly accurate site map, as well as recording high-definition images in order to create a computer model of the site.},

Recently, there is an increasing need for more accessible and precise close-range 3D acquisition technologies in some application fields like, for example, monitoring the growth of coral reefs or reconstructing underwater archaeological pieces that in most cases cannot be recovered from the seabed. This paper presents the first results of a research project that aims to investigate the possibility of using active optical techniques for the whole-field 3D reconstructions in an underwater environment. In this work we have tested an optical technique, frequently used for in air acquisition, based on the projection of structured lighting patterns acquired by a stereo vision system. We describe the experimental setup used for the underwater tests, which were conducted in a water tank with different turbidity conditions. The tests have evidenced that the quality of 3D reconstruction is acceptable even with high turbidity values, despite the heavy presence of scattering and absorption effects. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The unique feature of the site is that about 1/3 of the settlement of Phanagoria is currently flooded by waters of the Taman bay due to the transgression of the Black sea level since antiquity. In 2012 in the course of underwater prospection of the Taman bay a wooden ship buried under the 1.5 m thick bottom sediments was discovered in situ. The unique feature of the ship is excellent preservation of its wooden parts, which makes it one of the few finds of this kind ever made on the territory of Russia. This paper presents a case-study of application of photogrammetry technique for archaeological field documentation record in course of underwater excavations of the Phanagorian shipwreck. The advantages and possible underwaterspecific constraints of automated point cloud extraction algorithm which was used in the research are discussed. The paper gives an overview of the practical aspects of the workflow of photgrammetry technique application at the excavation ground: photo capture procedure and measurement of control points. Finally a resulting 3-D model of the shipwreck is presented and high potential of automated point cloud extraction algorithms for archaeological documentation record is concluded},

We have examined the possibilities and limitations of image-based 3D modeling in the recording of an entire excavation, and its impact on the workflow of the excavation process and the post-excavation processing. Our results suggest that image-based 3D modeling can be an excellent and suitable method for the recording, documentation and visualization of the excavated archaeological heritage. It offers great possibilities for increasing the quality of the archived archaeological excavation record. The high-resolution geometric information allows a straightforward quantification of the data. However it also brings along new challenges, including a change in the workflow of the excavation and the post-excavation process. Although there are limitations, these are greatly surpassed by the possibilities of the method.

The research described focuses on the problem of TAN implementation in underwater scenarios characterized by smooth sea-bottom topography and very shallow water, where the terrain information available for navigation is scarce. The navigation algorithms and the data fusion methods whose tests are documented in the paper build upon and expand prior theoretical work published by the authors; the TAN solutions adopted exploit the terrain information and the navigation data acquired with an inexpensive Doppler velocity logger (DVL) and a standard motion reference unit, respectively. The position estimation methods analyzed include a bi-dimensional particle filter (PF) and a four-dimensional Rao-Blackwellized PF that was designed to estimate the unknown Doppler velocity measurement biases responsible for the unbound localization errors typically observed in dead-recknoning navigation. The positioning accuracy achieved with these filters is compared with the output of a novel method, also proposed in the paper, that mechanizes a complementary-like filter designed to fuse the output of a TAN estimator with the velocity measurements provided by a DVL. Experimental results obtained during field tests with an autonomous marine vehicle are reported and analyzed.},

abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have a wide range of applications in marine geoscience, and are increasingly being used in the scientific, military, commercial, and policy sectors. Their ability to operate autonomously of a host vessel makes them well suited to exploration of extreme environments, from the world's deepest hydrothermal vents to beneath polar ice sheets. They have revolutionised our ability to image the seafloor, providing higher resolution seafloor mapping data than can be achieved from surface vessels, particularly in deep water. This contribution focuses on the major advances in marine geoscience that have resulted from AUV data. The primary applications are i) submarine volcanism and hydrothermal vent studies, ii) mapping and monitoring of low-temperature fluid escape features and chemosynthetic ecosystems, iii) benthic habitat mapping in shallow- and deep-water environments, and iv) mapping of seafloor morphological features (e.g. bedforms generated beneath ice or sediment-gravity flows). A series of new datasets is presented that highlight the growing versatility of AUVs for marine geoscience studies, including i) multi-frequency acoustic imaging of trawling impacts on deep-water coral mounds, iii) collection of high-resolution seafloor photomosaics at abyssal depths, and iii) velocity measurements of active submarine density flows. Future developments in AUV technology of potential relevance to marine geoscience include new vehicles with enhanced hovering, long endurance, extreme depth, or rapid response capabilities, while development of new sensors will further expand the range of geochemical parameters that can be measured. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Structural complexity strongly influences biodiversity and ecosystem productivity. On coral reefs, structural complexity is typically measured using a single and small-scale metric (‘rugosity') that represents multiple spatial attributes differentially exploited by species, thus limiting a complete understanding of how fish associate with reef structure. We used a novel approach to compare relationships between fishes and previously unavailable components of reef complexity, and contrasted the results against the traditional rugosity index. This study focused on damselfish to explore relationships between fishes and reef structure. Three territorial species, with contrasting trophic habits and expected use of the reef structure, were examined to infer the potential species-specific mechanisms associated with how complexity influences habitat selection. Three-dimensional reef reconstructions from photogrammetry quantified the following metrics of habitat quality: 1) visual exposure to predators and competitors, 2) density of predation refuges and 3) substrate-related food availability. These metrics explained the species distribution better than the traditional measure of rugosity, and each species responded to different complexity components. Given that a critical effect of reef degradation is loss of structure, adopting three-dimensional technologies potentially offers a new tool to both understand species-habitat association and help forecast how fishes will be affected by the flattening of reefs.},

These parameters are mainly used to control image quality, but have been heuristically determined by users. In this paper, we propose a novel method of determining two parameters of the CLAHE using entropy of image. The key idea is based on the characteristics of entropy curves: clip limit vs entropy and block size vs entropy. Clip limit and block size are determined at the point with maximum curvature on entropy curve. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves images with very low contrast.},

Conventional metrics with 2-dimensional properties are inadequate for characterization of reef structural complexity. A 3-dimensional (3D) approach can better quantify topography, rugosity and other structural characteristics that play an important role in the ecology of coral reef communities. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is an emerging low-cost photogrammetric method for high-resolution 3D topographic reconstruction. This study utilized SfM 3D reconstruction software tools to create textured mesh models of a reef at French Frigate Shoals, an atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The reconstructed orthophoto and digital elevation model were then integrated with geospatial software in order to quantify metrics pertaining to 3D complexity. The resulting data provided high-resolution physical properties of coral colonies that were then combined with live cover to accurately characterize the reef as a living structure. The 3D reconstruction of reef structure and complexity can be integrated with other physiological and ecological parameters in future research to develop reliable ecosystemmodels and improve capacity to monitor changes in the health and function of coral reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automated approach to correcting for colour inconsistency in underwater images collected from multiple perspectives during the construction of 3D structure-from-motion models. When capturing images underwater, the water column imposes several effects on images that are negligible in air such as colour-dependant attenuation and lighting patterns. These effects cause problems for human interpretation of images and also confound computer-based techniques for clustering and classification. Our approach exploits the 3D structure of the scene generated using structure-from-motion and photogrammetry techniques accounting for distance-based attenuation, vignetting and lighting pattern, and improves the consistency of photo-textured 3D models. Results are presented using imagery collected in two different underwater environments using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).},

A common approach for gait synthesis based on neural networks, is to use an implementation with Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Network (CTRNN) of arbitrary complex architecture as pattern generator for rhythmic limb motion. The preferred training method is implemented using genetic algorithms (GAs). However, to achieve the desired trajectory becomes an obstacle during the training process. This paper presents a much more simpler process converting a statically stable gait into actuators space via inverse kinematics; the training of the network is done with those references. By doing so, the training problem becomes a spatio-temporal machine learning problem.

This study focuses on four key structural complexity metrics: point-to-point distances, linear rugosity (R), fractal dimension (D), and vector dispersion (1/k). We present the first assessment of accuracy and precision of structure-from-motion (SfM) 3D models from an uncalibrated GoPro™ camera at a small scale (4 m2) and show that they can provide meaningful, ecologically relevant results. Models had root mean square errors of 1.48 cm in X-Y and 1.35 in Z, and accuracies of 86.8{\%} (R), 99.6{\%} (D at scales 30–60 cm), 93.6{\%} (D at scales 1–5 cm), and 86.9 (1/k). Values of R were compared to in-situ chain-and-tape measurements, while values of D and 1/k were compared with ground truths from 3D printed objects modelled underwater. All metrics varied less than 3{\%} between independently rendered models. We thereby improve and rigorously validate a tool for ecologists to non-invasively quantify coral reef structural complexity with a variety of multi-scale metrics.},

In order to ensure the quality of data collected, underwater inspection mission require a high stability AUV, especially in roll and pitch direction. However, conventional AUV adopt torpedo-shaped body, which has limited passive restoring moment in roll and pitch direction. Therefore, this paper presents design of a box-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle which is highly stable in roll and pitch direction. The passive stability of the designed autonomous underwater vehicle is improved by putting the heavy components at the bottom part of the vehicle whereas light component at the top part of the vehicle. The designed vehicle weights 68.8 kilogram in air with 0.6 kilogram positive buoyant. It has centre of buoyancy exactly above the centre of gravity with 7.39 centimeter metacentric height. By calculation, the vehicle will have 35.68 Newton meter restoring moment at 45 degree. By pool test, result shows that the vehicle is able to retain its original vertical axis as vertical without steady state error.},

abstract = {Digital photography is widely used by coral reef monitoring programs to assess benthic status and trends. In addition to creating a permanent archive, photographic surveys can be rapidly conducted, which is important in environments where bottom-time is frequently limiting. However, substantial effort is required to manually analyze benthic images; which is expensive and leads to lags before data are available. Using previously analyzed imagery from NOAA's Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program, we assessed the capacity of a trained and widely used machine-learning image analysis tool – CoralNet (coralnet.ucsd.edu) - to generate fully-automated benthic cover estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) and American Samoa. CoralNet was able to generate estimates of site-level coral cover for both regions that were highly comparable to those generated by human analysts (Pearson's r {\textgreater} 0.97, and with bias of 1{\%} or less). CoralNet was generally effective at estimating cover of common coral genera (Pearson's r {\textgreater} 0.92 and with bias of 2{\%} or less in 6 of 7 cases), but performance was mixed for other groups including algal categories, although generally better for American Samoa than MHI. CoralNet performance was improved by simplifying the classification scheme from genus to functional group and by training within habitat types, i.e., separately for coral-rich, pavement, boulder, or ‘other' habitats. The close match between human-generated and CoralNet-generated estimates of coral cover pooled to the scale of island and year demonstrates that CoralNet is capable of generating data suitable for assessing spatial and temporal patterns. The imagery we used was gathered from sites randomly located in {\textless}30 m hard-bottom at multiple islands and habitat-types per region, suggesting our results are likely to be widely applicable. As image acquisition is relatively straightforward, the capacity of fully-automated image analysis tools to minimize the need for resource intensive human analysts opens possibilities for enormous increases in the quantity and consistency of coral reef benthic data that could become available to researchers and managers.},

abstract = {This paper studies the dynamic stability of a positively buoyant Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in vertical plane for a level flight. Dynamic stability of underwater vehicles is estimated by using the linearized equations of motion about an equilibrium position. AUV is a slow moving and positively buoyant vehicle that enhances the stabilizing effect of the restoring forces. Hence a more general approach is required for the evaluation of stability. A 3 dof model for trajectory simulation for level depth trajectories is used to study the effect of positive buoyancy on vehicle trajectory at different speeds. The relative importance of the damping, restoring and control forces acting on the vehicle is established. The stability analysis is undertaken using linearized equations of motion considering the nonlinearities due to positive buoyancy. Numerical studies are carried out to estimate the fixed points of the system and eigenvalues at different forward speeds, metacentric heights and positive buoyancy for a level depth. The study shows that the stability changes from oscillatory to a steady node at a transition speed that depends on the metacentric height. The positive buoyancy has marginal effect on the transition speed but influences the sternplane angles and pitch of the vehicle.},

abstract = {Understanding how habitat complexity shapes fish communities is necessary to predict the consequences of future habitat change. On temperate rocky reefs, the presence and characteristics of canopy-forming kelps and the architectural complexity, or rugosity, of the underlying rocky substratum are foundational elements of habitat complexity. However, it is not yet clear how these factors shape the size structure of rocky-reef-associated fish communities. Here, we use biomass spectrum models to evaluate how fish community size structure in high-latitude rocky-reef kelp forests is shaped by substratum rugosity and the degree of closure and density of the kelp canopy. We found that the presence of a closed kelp canopy was associated with an average 75{\%} increase in overall fish biomass compared to open-canopy reefs. Furthermore, on the highest-rugosity reefs, the biomass of small fishes (32-64 g) was 800{\%} higher than on the lowest-rugosity reefs, while large fish (1-2 kg) biomass was 60{\%} lower. Consequently, biomass was more evenly distributed across body-size classes on high-rugosity reefs. By decomposing the biomass spectrum into total biomass and mean individual body mass, we found that higher kelp stipe densities also tended to be associated with larger fishes, but this effect was outweighed by the tendency for more small-bodied fishes with increasing rugosity. This study demonstrates how size-based analyses can give new insights into the ecology of temperate reef communities, and may be useful for tracking changes in kelp-associated assemblages in the coming decades with the maturation of marine protected areas, the recovery of sea otter populations, and changing climate.},

abstract = {Abstract. Corals act as ecosystem engineers by secreting structurally complex calcium carbonate skeletons on the benthic substrate that provide habitat for a diverse array of associated reef organisms. Communities of living corals create large and dynamic benthic structures that directly affect ecological parameters such as habitat provisioning and light availability, thus influencing overall ecosystem function. Despite the important role 3D structural complexity plays in ecosystem biodiversity and productivity, the field of coral ecology has lacked accessibility to practical technology capable of quantifying 3D characteristics of underwater habitats. Advancements in the field of computer vision has led to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, which provides a simple and cost-effective method for creating high-resolution and spatially accurate 3D reconstructions of natural environments. Integrating SfM approaches into coral reef research and monitoring has provided useful insight into the relationship between 3D habitat complexity and ecological processes. In this study, we examined the relationships among 2D estimates of live coral cover and several metrics of 3D habitat structural complexity among eleven long-term monitoring sites at French Frigate Shoals. Our findings show that coral assemblage structure acts as a significant driver of 3D structural complexity of coral reef habitats at this atoll. This study highlights the importance of diverse and abundant coral assemblages in supporting structurally complex coral reef habitats and provides a framework for future investigations into the ecological role of various coral morphotypes.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. The use of fluid lensing technology on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) is presented as a novel means for 3D imaging of aquatic ecosystems from above the water's surface at the centimetre scale. Preliminary results are presented from airborne fluid lensing campaigns conducted over the coral reefs of Ofu Island, American Samoa (2013) and the stromatolite reefs of Shark Bay, Western Australia (2014), covering a combined area of 15 km2. These reef ecosystems were revealed with centimetre-scale 2D resolution, and an accompanying 3D bathymetry model was derived using fluid lensing, Structure from Motion and UAV position data. Data products were validated from in situ survey methods including underwater calibration targets, depth measurements and millimetre-scale high-dynamic-range gigapixel photogrammetry. Fluid lensing is an experimental technology that uses water-transmitting wavelengths to passively image underwater objects at high-resolution by exploiting time-varying optical lensing events caused by surface waves. Fluid lensing data are captured from low-altitude, cost-effective electric UAVs to achieve multispectral imagery and bathymetry models at the centimetre scale over regional areas. As a passive system, fluid lensing is presently limited by signal-to-noise ratio and water column inherent optical properties to {\~{}}10 m depth over visible wavelengths in clear waters. The datasets derived from fluid lensing present the first centimetre-scale images of a reef acquired from above the ocean surface, without wave distortion. The 3D multispectral data distinguish coral, fish and invertebrates in American Samoa, and reveal previously undocumented, morphologically distinct, stromatolite structures in Shark Bay. These findings suggest fluid lensing and multirotor electric drones represent a promising advance in the remote sensing of aquatic environments at the centimetre scale, or ‘reef scale' relevant to the conservation of reef ecosystems. Pending further development and validation of fluid lensing methods, these technologies present a solution for large-scale 3D surveys of shallow aquatic habitats with centimetre-scale spatial resolution and hourly temporal sampling.

abstract = {One of the major challenges for coral reef science is to find sound management tools to reverse the rapid degradation of the world's reefs and their valuable ecosystem services. In this sense, much effort is dedicated to identify reef resilience indicators and traits, the restoration and protection of which can promote coral reef recovery following degradation. Here we examine two widely studied reef resilience traits, i.e. coral recruitment and structural complexity, and potential links between the two on different spatial scales that may be used to promote reef resilience by active restoration. Specifically, we explore the use of structural complexity enhancement (SCE; artificially increasing the complexity of a degraded reef by adding structures to it) as a potential restoration tool for increasing coral recruitment. Our SCE experiments resulted in an increase of 400–600{\%} in coral recruitment, which was correlated with some of the spatial scales of complexity. From a management perspective, the current study supports the idea that, under certain circumstances, SCE may serve as an effective restoration tool to enhance coral recruitment, which could be an alternative or addition to coral transplantation. The results also emphasize the importance of measuring and enhancing structural complexity on different spatial scales (from mm to m) for the promotion of different functional groups (e.g. corals and fish). This approach, if further developed, may serve as a key element in restoration projects of structurally degraded coral reefs.},

The description encompasses the full processing chain: from the image acquisition to the information extraction and data interpretation. The methods applied take advantage of existing tools and new, innovative and specific developments in order to acquire data on relevant ecological information concerning the structure and functioning of a red coral population. The tools presented here are based on: (i) automatic orientation using coded quadrats; (ii) use of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) and 3D skeletonization techniques; (iii) computation of distances between colonies from a same site; and (iv) the use of a plenoptic approach in an underwater environment.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Reef structural complexity provides important refuge habitat for a range of marine organisms, and is a useful indicator of the health and resilience of reefs as a whole. Marine scientists have recently begun to use ‘Structure from Motion' (SfM) photogrammetry in order to accurately and repeatably capture the 3D structure of physical objects underwater, including reefs. There has however been limited research on the comparability of this new method with existing analogue methods already used widely for measuring and monitoring 3D structure, such as ‘tape and chain rugosity index (RI)' and graded visual assessments. Our findings show that analogue and SfM RI can be reliably converted over a standard 10-m reef section (SfM RI = 1.348 × chain RI—0.359, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.82; and Chain RI = 0.606 × SfM RI + 0.465) for RI values up to 2.0; however, SfM RI values above this number become increasingly divergent from traditional tape and chain measurements. Additionally, we found SfM RI correlates well with visual assessment grades of coral reefs over a 10 × 10 m area (SfM RI = 0.1461 × visual grade + 1.117; {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.83). The SfM method is shown to be affordable and non-destructive whilst also allowing the data collected to be archival, less biased by the observer, and broader in its scope of applications than standard methods. This work allows researchers to easily transition from analogue to digital structural assessment techniques, facilitating continued long-term monitoring, whilst also improving the quality and additional research value of the data collected. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, rising ocean temperatures and associated coral bleaching threaten the structural integrity of these important ecosystems. Despite the increased frequency of coral bleaching events, few studies to date have examined changes in three-dimensional (3D) reef structural complexity following severe bleaching. The influence of local stressors on reef complexity also remains poorly understood. In the wake of the 2015-2016 El Ni{\~{n}}o-induced mass coral bleaching event, we quantified the effects of severe heat stress on 3D reef structural complexity across a gradient of local human disturbance. Using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry we created 3D reconstructions of permanent reef plots and observed substantial declines in reef structural complexity, measured as surface rugosity and terrain ruggedness, and a detectable loss of habitat volume one year after the bleaching event. 3D reef complexity also declined with increasing levels of human disturbance, and with decreasing densities of branching and massive corals. These findings improve our understanding of the effects of local and global stressors on the structural foundation of coral reef ecosystems. In the face of accelerating climate change, mitigating local stressors may increase reef structural complexity, thereby heightening reef resilience to future bleaching events.},

abstract = {The morphology of coral colonies has important implications for their biological and ecological performance, including their role as ecosystem engineers. However, given that morphology is difficult to quantify across many taxa, morphological variation is typically shoehorned into coarse growth form categories (e.g., arborescent and digitate). In this study, we develop a quantitative schema for morphology by identifying three-dimensional shape variables that can describe coral morphology. We contrast six variables estimated from 152 laser scans of coral colonies that ranged across seven growth form categories and three orders of magnitude of size. We found that 88{\%} of the variation in shape was captured by two axes of variation and three shape variables. The main axis was variation in volume compactness (cf. sphericity) and the second axis was the trade-off between surface complexity and the vertical distribution of volume (i.e., top heaviness). Variation in volume compactness also limited variation along the second axis, where surface complexity and vertical volume distribution ranged more freely when compactness was low. Traditional growth form categories occupied distinct regions within this morpho-space. However, these regions overlapped due to shape changes with colony size. Nonetheless, four of the shape variables were able to predict traditional growth form categories with 70 to 95{\%} accuracy, suggesting that the continuous variables captured much of the qualitative variation inherently implied by these growth forms. Distilling coral morphology into geometric variables that capture shape variation will allow for better tests of the mechanisms that govern coral biology, ecology and ecosystem services such as reef building and provision of habitat.},

abstract = {Structural complexity in ecosystems creates an assortment of microhabitat types and has been shown to support greater diversity and abundance of associated organisms. The 3D structure of an environment also directly affects important ecological parameters such as habitat provisioning and light availability and can therefore strongly influence ecosystem function. Coral reefs are architecturally complex 3D habitats, whose structure is intrinsically linked to the ecosystem biodiversity, productivity, and function. The field of coral ecology has, however, been primarily limited to using 2-dimensional (2D) planar survey techniques for studying the physical structure of reefs. This conventional approach fails to capture or quantify the intricate structural complexity of corals that influences habitat facilitation and biodiversity. A 3-dimensional (3D) approach can obtain accurate measurements of architectural complexity, topography, rugosity, volume, and other structural characteristics that affect biodiversity and abundance of reef organisms. Structurefrom- Motion (SfM) photogrammetry is an emerging computer vision technology that provides a simple and cost-effective method for 3D reconstruction of natural environments. SfM has been used in several studies to investigate the relationship between habitat complexity and ecological processes in coral reef ecosystems. This study compared two commercial SfM software packages, Agisoft Photoscan Pro and Pix4Dmapper Pro 3.1, in order to assess the cpaability and spatial accuracy of these programs for conducting 3D modeling of coral reef habitats at three spatial scales.},

abstract = {A large autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV), the Seahorse, has been designed, constructed, and tested by the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU, University Park, PA) for the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO, Stennis Space Center, MS). The vehicle is required to launch in shallow water ({\&}lt;10 m) and to hover without propulsion. Additionally, due to the very large size of the vehicle, low operating speeds and very long missions, small changes in vehicle trim resulting from battery replacement, sensor exchanges, and water temperature variations can result in significant drag-induced energy penalties over the duration of a mission. It is, therefore, important to continually maintain the AUV in fore-aft trim over the course of the mission. The vehicle is equipped with a two tank variable buoyancy system (VBS) to meet these requirements. The resulting control problem is one where the control variable, pump rate, is proportional to the third derivative of the sensed variable, depth; there are significant delays, and forces are nonlinear (including discontinuous) and highly uncertain. This paper describes the design of the VBS and the control software operating in two modes: depth control mode and trim control mode. In-water test data and simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the VBS controller. The benefits of the presented approach lie in the intuitiveness and simplicity of the design and the robustness as evidenced by the performance in both fresh and salt water. This paper provides practical insight into the operation of a VBS with an AUV and discusses actual operational experience. To our knowledge, no previous work considers the significance of an observed surface capture phenomenon to the design of a VBS control system, especially in very shallow water.},

abstract = {The midwater column of the ocean has been largely unexplored by man. These are regions below the sun-lit upper ocean and above the seafloor. According to the Monterrey Aquarium 2004 Annual Report the midwater column contains the largest communities of species in the world. Despite this, very little is known about the biodiversity in this region of the water column [1]. Little imagery of these species in their natural environment exists. An autonomous, deep-submergence, buoyancy-compensated 'Driftcam' has been developed to probe the mesopelagic and bathypelagic regions of the water column. The system utilizes an HD video camera and a 7200 lm LED lighting system inside a polished borosilicate spherical pressure housing. An embedded computer controls the camera and lighting. An electrically driven, hydraulic buoyancy engine has been developed to facilitate depth control through the water column. The buoyancy engine utilizes an encoder-less, stepper-motor driven, hydraulic piston to pump inert oil to and from an external bladder. A pressure transducer provides depth feedback to an embedded, intelligent motor drive. The Driftcam is designed for a controlled operating depth of up to 1500 m and a recoverable depth of 6000 m. Surface recovery is facilitated by a light beacon, a VHF beacon, and an ARGOS satellite transmitter capable of functioning for 1 year. In addition, the system is highly portable, measuring 1.5 m in total length. To date, the system has been deployed over 8 times to depths beyond 100 meters. Keywords—Lagrangian;},

The presented effort addresses the two main characteristics of the shallow coastal environment that preclude the direct of use of many successfully deep water floats, namely the higher variation of water densities near the coast compared with the open ocean and the highly varied bathymetry. Our idea is to develop a high capacity dynamic auto-ballasting system that is able to compensate for the expected seawater density variation over a broad range of water temperatures and salinities while using measurements of both pressure and altitude above the bottom. The major components of the float consist of a Netburner micro processor, rechargeable lithium ion battery system, piston style volume changing mechanism, sensors for pressure and altitude, and a safely system for recovery and emergency conditions. Results are presented for field tests that verify the performance of the float for a variety of behaviors that are of general utility for both water tracking an profile sampling.},

Progress toward this goal is reviewed by analyzing the performance of nearly Lagrangian floats deployed in a variety of oceanic flows. Two new float types, described in this paper, are autonomous with durations of months, can alternate between Lagrangian and profiling modes, relay data via satellite, and can carry a variety of sensors. A novel hull design is light, strong, and has a compressibility close to that of seawater. The key to making floats accurately Lagrangian is an improved understanding of the factors that control float buoyancy and motion. Several insights are presented here. Anodized aluminum gains weight in seawater due to reactions between its surface and seawater. At low pressure the buoyancy of floats with O-ring seals varies as if attached bubbles of air were being compressed. The volume of “air” decays exponentially with a decay scale of a few days from 10 to 30 cc at deployment ...},

abstract = {The design and operation of neutrally buoyant floats that attempt to track the three-dimensional motion of water parcels in highly turbulent regions of the ovean, such as the upper mixed later, are described. These floats differ from previous floats by combining high drag, a compressibility that nearly match that of seawater, rapid (1 hz) sampling, and short-range, high-precision acoustic tracking. Examples of float data are showen with the twin goals of demonstrating the utility of the floats and estimating the accuracy to which they are "Lagrangian" The analysis indicates that these floats follow the motion of the surrounding water to better than o.o1 m/s under most circumstances. Both the net bouyancy of the float and its finite size contribute to the error. The float's bouyancy is controlled by making its compressibility very close to that of seawater, by making its drag large, by reducing air pockets and bubbles on the float, and by carefully controlling variations in the float's mass and volume between deployments. The float accuractely follows that part of the velocity field with sca;es much larger than its own size (1 m) but does not follow componants with scales smaller than iteself. A model of this dependence is presented for turbulent flows. Several unique measurements are possible with these floats. They measure vertical displacement using pressure and therefor accurately filter out the vertical velocity of surface waves, since the linear surface waves have no pressure fluctuations along Lagrangian trajectories. Accuract measurements of vertical velocity in the oceanic mixed later are therefore possible. This, combined with temperature, can be used to measure vertical heat flux. A compass measures the spin rate of the float and thus the vertical vorticity. In fully turbulent flows with outer scales much larger than the float size, the spectra of both the veertical velocity and vorticity scale with e (TKE dissipation) over a wide range of e values, thus allowing e to be measured. The floats can, in principle, therefor measure many important porperties of turbulent flows even in the presence of surface waves.},

abstract = {A hybrid depth control approach, which utilizes both active buoyancy control and a bi-directional vertical thruster, is presented for the Shallow Water Lagrangian Imaging Float. The approach is shown to reduce propulsion power and increase tracking accuracy compared to a single actuator system. Results are presented from field trials at Cordell Bank Marine Sanctuary and Scott Reef Nature Reserve at depths up to 60 m. Using heuristically tuned controllers, the hybrid actuation approach reduces average propulsion power by 65{\%} with respect to a thruster-only system, and by 73{\%} with respect to a piston-only system. A further 58{\%} reduction in power consumption, and a 26{\%} reduction in mean tracking error, is realized by combining state feedback control with a pair of complementary filters. The complementary filters are used to allocate vertical force command between the two actuation modes. Simulations are used to demonstrate that the power savings compared to a thruster-only system result from elimination of steady state trim errors that are otherwise inevitable in field deployments. The control architecture described allows the user to directly tune (a) the time constant of the desired first-order system dynamics and (b) the frequency cutoff between control using the slow active buoyancy system and control using the fast bi-directional thruster. The results indicate that hybrid actuation and complementary filtering for control allocation are enabling technologies for energy-constrained deep water platforms.},

abstract = {Acoustic imaging and characterisation of buried objects (and in particular archaeological materials) in shallow-water ({\textless}5 m) is often unsuccessful owing to problems related to vessel-induced bubble turbulence and the restricted acoustic geometry of the system. A 2D surveying method that tackles these problems has been tested on the known wreck of the Grace Dieu (1418), Henry V's flagship, currently buried within the inter-tidal sediments of the Hamble River. The wooden hull is recognisable in the seismic sections as a high amplitude anomaly underlain by an acoustic blanking zone. Close survey line spacing (ca. 1 m) allowed the construction of time slices, identifying the ovate plan of the hull. High, predominantly negative, reflection coefficients suggest this anomaly corresponds to degraded oak timbers buried within the sediment. Combining the data enabled the construction of a (pseudo)-3D image, revealing the dimensions and shape of the hull remains for the first time. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Effective marine archaeological site management demands detailed information on not only the spatial distribution of artefacts but also the degradation state of the materials present. Although sonar methods have frequently been used in an attempt to detect buried wooden shipwrecks they are currently unable to indicate their degradation state. To assess the sensitivity of acoustic measurements to changes in the degradation state of such material, and hence the potential for sonars to quantify degradation, laboratory measurements of compressional wave velocity, as well as bulk density for oak and pine samples, in varying states of decay, were undertaken. These data enabled the calculation of theoretical reflection coefficients for such materials buried in various marine sediments. As wood degrades, the reflection coefficients become more negative, resulting in the hypothesis that the more degraded wood becomes, the easier it should be to detect. Typical reflection coefficients of the order of -0.43 and -0.52 for the most degraded oak and pine samples in sand are predicted. Conversely, for wood exposed to seawater the predicted reflection coefficients are large and positive for undegraded material (0.35 for oak, 0.18 for pine) and decrease to zero or slightly below for the most degraded samples. This indicates that exposed timbers, when heavily degraded, can be acoustically transparent and so undetectable by acoustic methods. Corroboration of these experimental results was provided through comparison with high resolution seismic reflection data that has been acquired over two shipwrecks.},

The float is an over actuated system in depth/altitude, which is the only degree of freedom controlled. Vertical control is accomplished using a combination of active buoyancy modulation and a conventional propeller thruster. The proposed depth control algorithm is designed to take advantage of the high authority, high bandwidth inputs available from the thruster, and the low bandwidth trim input available from the buoyancy controller. The float vertical dynamics are modeled as a double integrator in the input force, and empirically derived parameters are used to simulate actuator inputs and system response over pre-recorded bathymetry profiles. Simulation and preliminary experimental results indicate that significant reductions in actuator power can be achieved in field conditions, and that the combination of thruster and buoyancy control provide the altitude tracking performance required for benthic imaging.},

Through the comparison of comprehensive post--survey dredging of the entire site with a prestack time migrated 3D volume, it has been possible to confirm a 100 {\%} detection rate for all discrete buried objects larger than 0.30 m by 0.30 m in illuminated area, although one acoustic anomaly could not be accounted for in the dredging results.},

abstract = {Since the beginning, Clusterin (CLU) was revealed not as simple to study, and certainly not a single protein. The growing research interest on CLU soon produced many contributions by independent laboratories working in different systems. Thus, many different names or acronyms have been given to CLU in the early years after its discovery. Now, a general consensus recommend the name Clusterin and the abbreviation CLU. CLU was first described as a glycoprotein found nearly ubiquitous in tissues and body fluids. This early knowledge is mostly related to the secretory form of CLU (sCLU), which is exported from the cell and released in secretions acting as an extracellular chaperone. But CLU can also enter the nucleus. The detection of nCLU (nuclear CLU), which is usually associated to cell death, is now emerging as a very important event making this issue even more complex. This may explain why CLU is still often described as an "enigmatic" protein. The use of the term "enigmatic" is a clear indication that too many aspects related to the biological function(s) of CLU and its possible role in pathogenesis have been obscure, or very difficult to interpret, for long time. Contradictory findings on CLU are also present in the literature, sometimes due to technical biases or alternative interpretation of the same result. The aim of the book is ambitious: through a careful review of old data, in the light of novel information and up to date methods and hypotheses, we will try to simplify the picture for the reader and bring more light in a field still perceived to be too obscure to fully appreciate its importance and potential implementation in the clinical setting. This introduction will provide a brief general history and a critical view of the discovery of CLU with the aim to underline what is new in the field and what is now obsolete. In the rest of the book, conclusions and "take home messages" will also be provided to the reader particularly focusing on possible clinical implementations and how all this knowledge will very likely bring novelty in the fight against cancer.},

abstract = {The remains of Henry V's flagship, the Grace Dieu, currently lie buried within the inter-tidal sediments of the River Hamble (S. England). Previous archaeological investigations have been hindered by difficult excavation conditions resulting in a poor understanding of the dimensions, shape and degradation state of the hull's deeper structure. This study therefore aimed to image, characterize and reconstruct the buried remains of this vessel using a high-resolution 3D acoustic sub-bottom Chirp system with RTK-GPS positioning capability. The accurate navigation and high-resolution data that were acquired enabled the construction of a full 3D image of the site that not only identified the remains of the wooden hull, but also features buried within it. In addition, the degradation state of these buried wooden remains were investigated by calculating reflection coefficients while a hypothetical larger reconstruction of the Grace Dieu's hull was achieved, through the use of the ShipShape ship design software package. The results of this project demonstrate that (i) acoustic data can be used to successfully image buried wooden shipwrecks, (ii) artefacts are buried within the hull of the Grace Dieu, (iii) there is variation in the degradation state of the buried timbers, as calculated from the acoustic data, with the shell of the vessel being moderately well preserved, and (iv) the Grace Dieu was a very large ship for its time (possibly over 60 m long and 16 m wide). The outcomes of this research not only have considerable implications for the management and monitoring of submerged and buried archaeological sites but also for planning intrusive surveys, should they be required. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The increasing availability of large, detailed digital representations of the Earth's surface demands the application of objective and quantitative analyses. Given recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of formation of linear bedform features from a range of environments, objective measurement of their wavelength, orientation, crest and trough positions, height and asymmetry is highly desirable. These parameters are also of use when determining observation-based parameters for use in many applications such as numerical modelling, surface classification and sediment transport pathway analysis. Here, we (1) adapt and extend extant techniques to provide a suite of semi-automatic tools which calculate crest orientation, wavelength, height, asymmetry direction and asymmetry ratios of bedforms, and then (2) undertake sensitivity tests on: synthetic data; increasingly complex seabeds; and a very large scale (39,000 km2) aeolian dune system. The automated results arecompared with traditional, manually-derived, measurements at each stage. This new approach successfully analyses different types of topographic data (from aeolian and marine environments) from a range of sources, with tens of millions of data points being processed in a semi-automated and objective manner within minutes rather than hours or days. The results from these analyses show there is significant variability in all measurable parameters in what might otherwise be considered uniform bedform fields. For example, the dunes of the Rub' al Khali on the Arabian peninsula are shown to exhibit deviations in dimensions from global trends.

The remains appear as strong reflectors underlain by an acoustic blanking zone, which was used to create maps of the wreck material. Close survey line-spacing allowed the construction of contour maps and hull sections, which revealed that the bow and stern sections are tilted to port at different angles, implying that they are detached.

abstract = {The archaeological record represents a window on-to the complex relationship between stone artefact variance and hominin behaviour. Differences in the shapes and sizes of stone flakes—the most abundant remains of past behav-iours for much of human evolutionary history—may be underpinned by variation in a range of different environmental and behavioural factors. Controlled flake production experi-ments have drawn inferences between flake platform prepara-tion behaviours, which have thus far been approximated by linear measurements, and different aspects of overall stone flake variability (Dibble and Rezek J Archaeol Sci 36:1945– 1954, 2009; Lin et al. Am Antiq 724–745, 2013; Magnani et al. J Archaeol Sci 46:37–49, 2014; Rezek et al. J Archaeol Sci 38:1346–1359, 2011). However, when the re-sults are applied to archaeological assemblages, there remains a substantial amount of unexplained variability. It is unclear whether this disparity between explanatory models and ar-chaeological data is a result of measurement error on certain key variables, whether traditional analyses are somehow a general limiting factor, or whether there are additional flake shape and size drivers that remain unaccounted for. To try and circumvent these issues, here, we describe a shape analysis approach to assessing stone flake variability including a newly developed three-dimensional geometric morphometric meth-od ('3DGM'). We use 3DGM to demonstrate that a relation-ship between platform and flake body governs flake shape and size variability. Contingently, we show that by using this 3DGM approach, we can use flake platform attributes to both (1) make fairly accurate stone flake size predictions and (2) make relatively detailed predictions of stone flake shape. Whether conscious or instinctive, an understanding of this geometric relationship would have been critical to past knap-pers effectively controlling the production of desired stone flakes. However, despite being able to holistically and accu-rately incorporate three-dimensional flake variance into our analyses, the behavioural drivers of this variance remain elusive.},

Based on an expedient, in-field model processing protocol, we report preliminary results concerning the accuracy of artifact provenience information derived from photogrammetry models of excavation surfaces at the Upper Palaeolithic site of Shuidonggou Locality 2 in China. Error in model-derived provenience can range easily into the centimeter scale; accuracy in some spatial axes are significantly, but weakly, affected by the size of the sampled surface. While the observed error range is larger than thresholds proposed for Palaeolithic excavations, it is arguably acceptable in settings where the analytical demand for provenience precision is lower. We identify possible sources of error and discuss how model accuracy can be improved by additional systematic testing.},

Watershed councils are composed of interested governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders that form to collaboratively manage water and other natural resources at the scale of a watershed. This research is the first step in a multi-step policy analysis designed to answer the question of whether watershed councils are an improvement over traditional methods of public involvement in natural resource management. This paper outlines why watershed councils form and discusses their structure and operation. There is considerable variability in terms of watershed councils' goals, their effectiveness, stakeholder composition, their involvement in the "real" decision-making process, types of participation that are allowed, leadership, financing, decision-making procedures, efficiency, and temporal scale. These structural components are presented as a framework that can be used by researchers to develop criteria to evaluate watershed councils.},

abstract = {Due to the growing interest using model predictive control (MPC), there are more and more researches about the applications of MPC on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and these researches are mainly focused on simulation and simple application of MPC on AUV. This paper focuses on the improvement of MPC based on the state space model of an AUV. Unlike the previous approaches using a fixed weighting matrix, in this paper, a coefficient, varied with the error, is introduced to adjust the control increment vector weighting matrix to reduce the settling time. Then, an analysis on the effect of the adjustment to the stability is given. In addition, there is always a lag between the AUV real trajectory and the desired trajectory when the AUV tracks a continuous trajectory. To solve this problem, a simple re-planning of the desired trajectory is developed. Specifically, the point certain steps ahead from current time on the desired trajectory is treated as the current desired point and input to the controller. Finally, experimental results for depth control are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the improved MPC. Experimental results show that the method of real-time adjusting control increment weighting matrix can reduce settling time by about 2 s when tracking step trajectory of 1 m, and the simple re-planning of the desired trajectory method can reduce the average of absolute error by about 15{\%} and standard deviation of error by about 17{\%}.},

For this reasons, the classification of coral species has always required an aid from a domain expert. The objective of this paper is to develop an accurate classification model for coral texture images. Current datasets contain a large number of imbalanced classes, while the images are subject to inter-class variation. We have focused on the current small datasets and analyzed (1) several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, (2) data augmentation techniques and (3) transfer learning approaches. We have achieved the state-of-the art accuracies using different variations of ResNet on the two small coral texture datasets, EILAT and RSMAS.},

abstract = {An experiment with different AUVs was carried out in the Mar Menor Coastal Lagoon from October 31 to November 5 in order to measure and assess the influence of the water from the Mar Menor on the adjacent area of the Mediterranean. This was carried out as a result of the meeting held between several institutions from the Iberian Peninsula and EEUU (see Vilanova Marine Science/Robotics Meeting 2010). The experiment was to launch several AUVs at the same time in different zones of the Mediterranean and Mar Menor lagoon. AUVs took salinity data trying to do a coordinated mission during two operative days (November 3 and November 5). Others days of the experiment were used to the vehicle's preparation and error correction (November 2 and November 4). This paper presents the steps followed in preparation and operative days with the set of AUVs. This paper presents also the salinity results obtained during these missions.},

abstract = {In recent years the underwater navigation industry has expanded into more diverse and unique applications requiring a greater capability from its platform sensor set. Teledyne RD Instruments has answered the demand with a new patented Phased Array technology to be used as part of the growing Doppler Velocity Log and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler Product Lines. The new Phased Array utilizes a single array transducer composed of multiple elements where four individual acoustic beams are electronically formed at their defined angles. In contrast the existing piston transducer technology utilizes the four individual ceramics where each beam is projected at its respective mounting angle. This yields the opportunity to increase the size of the single array while reducing the overall transducer size giving way for the characteristics which provide for operational improvement. These unique advantages and benefits are outlined in a user centric focus. Through substantial research and development our engineers have designed a method through a filled array process to pressure rate the transducer to a depth of 1000 meters. In terms of the mechanical configuration the attributes are represented and shown how the single phased array contributes to the system design and integration to allow for improved platform cohesion. Furthermore the variables that affect the systems integration and data collection are presented in both a theoretical and experimental means. This is defined by bandwidth and effective speed of sound. Teledyne RD Instruments has been continuing to work towards operational improvement and as such have two products available with our Phased Array transducers, the Explorer DVL and our new PAVS150. The Explorer DVL is tested to compare the piston transducer with our Phased Array transducer option. In this comparison the data will be examined where features such as maximum bottom tracking range, maximum current profiling range, standard deviation vs. altitude and standard deviation vs. bin size. Furthermore the recently released PAVS150 which boasts a bottom tracking range in excess of 500 meters takes to the ocean to define its capabilities. The compact and powerful PAVS150 uses our proven bottom detection algorithms and single ping bottom location capability with its broadband velocity processing technology to provide high-precision velocity data for reliable navigation and position processing in a highly robust and reliable manner over any indeterminate terrain.},

The controller design proceeds with different stages exploiting the benefit of having a preserved PCH structure of the system while in closed loop. An extension of L 2  disturbance attenuation control design under the assumption that the exogenous disturbance has a different input gain is also presented. Necessary and sufficient conditions to guaranty stability are stated. Robustness of the controller to parameter uncertainties is studied by assuming uncertain inertia and damping matrices. The design approach is applied to develop a PCH-based path tracking and L  2  disturbance attenuation controllers for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The simulation results demonstrate the performance of the designed controller in tracking both an horizontal plane path and a vertical plane path that passes through the singularity points. The simulation results indicate that the designed controller is robust enough to uncertainties in inertia and damping matrices. In addition, the extension of L 2  disturbance attenuation controller is able to attenuate the exogenous disturbance effect on AUV path tracking.},

The focal length, frame rate and exposure time, which determine the frame capturing process, in association with the speed of the vehicle determine the capabilities of the vision-based navigation system. In this work, we quantify the effect of the above imaging parameters on the performance of the vision system, and the feasibility of vision-based navigation is assessed for various parameter values. Results demonstrate that a 1200 × 1600 camera with a 5mm lens and 15f /s frame rate allows the dense reconstruction of the ocean floor, thus enabling autonomous underwater navigation, provided there is enough processing power on the vehicle to perform the necessary image processing in real time.},

In this paper, we propose a strategy that utilizes ocean model predictions to increase the autonomy and control of Lagrangian or profiling floats for precisely this purpose. An A* planner is applied to a local controllability map generated from predictions of ocean currents to compute a path between prescribed waypoints that has the highest likelihood of successful execution. The control to follow the planned path is computed by use of a model predictive controller. This controller is designed to select the best depth for the vehicle to exploit ambient currents to reach the goal waypoint. Mission constraints are employed to simulate a practical data collection mission. Results are presented in simulation for a mission off the coast of Los Angeles, CA USA, and show surprising results in the ability of a Lagrangian float to reach a desired location.},

It is proposed to investigate an alternative configuration with the aid of statistical learning methods such as Support Vector Machines for the localization of these vehicles during the operation in this environment.

@article{Teixeira2012,
abstract = {Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) holds high potential for integration with classical dead-reckoning methods in underwater vehicles that do not have access to the global positioning system (GPS). The TAN approach constitutes an economical solution for long-range oceano-graphic missions that cannot afford the cost of high-grade inertial navigation systems or the logistics associated to the deployment of long acoustic baselines. Successful implementations of the terrain navigation concept require efficient and robust algorithms for estimation of the vehicle kinematic states. Current implementations of terrain-based navigation rely essentially on a class of nonlinear filters commonly designated particle filters (PF) due to their versatility and robustness. However, there are some typical problems posed by TAN applications that require further investigation since they are not adequately solved by standard PF algorithms. The present paper addresses the problem of efficiency and robustness of particle filters in the context of terrain based navigation. To this effect, we present two new filter versions that are shown to be more robust and to achieve superior performance in terms of position and velocity estimation. When applied to TAN, the new PF formulations mitigate filter divergence problems frequently caused by terrain symmetries and are more robust than other well-known versions when used in scenarios with poor terrain information.},

abstract = {A visual odometer can estimate robot motion by tracking a set of invariant keypoints over a sequence of camera frames, at a computational cost that is roughly linear in the number of extracted keypoints. The leading literature suggests to extract all keypoints with a response value—e.g., a Laplacian or Hessian determinant—above a given threshold. We find that the number of image keypoints that pass a given threshold is highly variable between images, which is impractical for real time systems where motion needs to be estimated in constant time. Here we propose to extract a constant number of keypoints that have the highest response for their respective frame. To find the optimal number of extracted keypoints, we define a range of thresholds on odometer performance, and study how the number of image pairs for which a visual odometer passes the thresholds depends on the number of extracted keypoints. We find that the shapes of the resulting graphs are relatively invariant to the chosen threshold values and that for all threshold values the region where good odometer performance is balanced with computational efficiency is relatively small. We conclude that if odometer performance has to be weighed against computational cost, there is relatively little room for trade, and that a robust optimum can quickly and easily be found.},

Possible applications include maintenance intervention in permanent observatories and offshore scenarios, and search {\&} recovery for collecting objects of interest for different application domains like biology, fishery, or marine rescue just to name a few. Nowadays, these kind of tasks are usually solved with “work class” ROVs (i.e. Remote Operated Vehicles) that are launched from support vessels, and remotely operated by expert pilots through an umbilical communications cable and complex control interfaces. These solutions present several drawbacks. Firstly, ROVs are normally large and heavy vehicles that need significant logistics for its transportation and handling. Secondly, the complex user interfaces and control methods require skilled pilots for their use. These two facts significantly increase the cost of the applications. Moreover, the need of an umbilical cable introduces additional problems of control, or range limitation. The fatigue and high stress that users of remotely operated systems normally suffer supposes another serious drawback. All the pointed questions justify the need of more autonomous, cheap and easyto-use solutions for underwater intervention missions, and this is the aim of the current FP7-TRIDENT project. So, in this paper an overview concerning the main research ongoing under this project will be presented and discussed.},

abstract = {We investigate the use of ADCP current profiles as a navigation aid to a descending UUV. A UUV can have a position fix from GPS at the surface, and can use bottom track for dead reckoning once it has descended to within tracking range of the bottom. The challenge is to determine the vehicle's position at the bottom, by tracking its motion through the transition from surface to bottom. The use of earth-referenced current profiles during the descent can provide an estimate of the water reference frame and therefore an estimation of the vehicle motion. GPS position and velocity combined with current profiles measured at the surface provide the first earth referenced measurement of the water reference frame. During the descent, subsequent profiles provide profile gradients that can be used to extend the earth-referenced profile to the bottom. This extrapolation of earth referenced current profiles can provide the means to estimate vehicle motion below the surface before the vehicle has reached the bottom. Once bottom track is achieved the corrected reference for vehicle motion can be used to improve the estimate of position. Feeding the water layer estimates, and eventually the bottom track, into a relatively simple Kalman filter is one way to weight the estimates of water reference layer and bottom track appropriately. This solution also provides real-time position that will allow longer distances between position fixes.},

abstract = {This paper describes a probabilistic surface matching method for pose-based bathymetry SLAM using a multibeam sonar profiler. The proposed algorithm compounds swath profiles of the seafloor with dead reckoning localization to build surface patches. Then, a probabilistic implementation of the ICP is used to deal with the uncertainty of the robot pose as well as the measured points in a two-stage process including point-to-point and point-to-plane metrics. A novel surface adaptation using octrees is proposed to have ICP-derived methods working in feature-poor or highly unstructured areas typical of bathymetric scenarios. Moreover, a heuristic based on the uncertainties of the surface points is used to improve the basic algorithm, decreasing the ICP complexity to O(n). The performance of the method is demonstrated with real data from a bathymetric survey.},

abstract = {This paper describes work done towards the development of advanced geophysical-based navigation systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The specific problem that we tackle is that of combining terrain-aided navigation (TAN) with single-beacon navigation (SBN) techniques. The resulting complementary TAN/SBN system has the potential to overcome some of the problems that arise with TAN navigation only, when an AUV undergoes motions that lead it temporarily across areas where the terrain below is not sufficiently “rich” in terms of topographic features. The key contribution of this paper is a formal analysis of the benefits of using complementary filtering, in opposition to TAN navigation only. To this effect, we exploit key tools of estimation theory, and in particular the Cram´er-Rao lower bound inequality to obtain a lower bound on the minimum covariance of the estimation error that can be obtained with any unbiased estimator. For a real terrain profile we compute and compare the Cram´er- Rao lower bounds for TAN only and TA/SB-based navigation. The increase in the expected performance that can be achieved with the second solution is clearly visible. The efficacy of the new solution proposed is illustrated with the help of computer simulations.},

The algorithm takes advantage of the integral-image representation to quickly compute features, and progressively reduces the computational load by working on smaller portions of the image along the detection process phases. By adhering to the proposed scheme, real-time detection on sonar data onboard an autonomous vehicle is made possible. The proposed method does not require training data, as it dynamically takes into account environmental characteristics of the sensed sonar data. The proposed approach has been implemented and integrated into the software system of the Gemellina autonomous surface vehicle, and is able to run in real time. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated on real experiments carried out at sea with the Gemellina autonomous surface vehicle.},

abstract = {An approach to improve the navigational accuracy of underwater vehicles using patches of bathymetry acquired selectively from the terrain as observations within a Simultane- ous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) framework is presented. Each patch is filtered and stored as a gridded sub-map, or Navigation Cell, in the dynamic system model, along with the vehicle pose. Upon subsequent crossings over the same patch, additional cells are stored, then correlated against the original and the observations updated accordingly. The updated observations are fed into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which updates the vehicle state. The approach has been demonstrated in simulation, using both synthetically generated bathymetry and real terrain data collected from a surface-vessel mounted micro-bathymetric sonar. It was found that the error build-up could be effectively bounded by employing the selective approach, whilst keeping the system state to a manageable size for real-time adoption. The locations of Navigation Cells can be both pre-defined and dynamically located at points where the terrain variability is high. In addition, any Navigation Cell can be chosen by the mission controller to be re-visited for correlation, should the vehicle's estimated state covariance exceed some pre-defined threshold. The paper concludes with some discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the technique.},

All these are implemented on the same free open source library which allows a fair comparison that can establish the best technique (depending on the criteria used). Taking into account previous work where SURF and template correlation techniques were evaluated using a batch of data collected in typical operating conditions with the Romeo ROV, the other techniques are compared using the same data set. In estimating vehicle speed, SURF and SIFT presented noise levels higher but close to template correlation, though SURF and SIFT have more outliers. In terms of computational time, template correlation outperforms all other alternatives by large in some cases.},

Although this fruit is highly popular locally, its commercial farming is virtually nonexistent. In addition, limited studies on this fruit have been conducted. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the physical, chemical, and functional characteristics of two uvaia fruit populations grown in Sales{\'{o}}polis, SP, Brazil, in order to determine their potential for being consumed both in natura and processed. Uvaia fruits were evaluated as for skin color, whole fruit weight, longitudinal and transversal diameters, seed percentage, pulp yield, pulp firmness, pH, total soluble solids (TSS), total titratable acidity (TTA), TSS/TTA ratio, total soluble sugars, soluble and total pectins, total carotenoids, yellow flavonoids, total phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, and in vitro antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ORAC assays). The total mineral content was also determined. Comparison among the two populations revealed that uvaia fruits showed significantly different firmness values, large fruits showing suitable characteristics for the fresh fruit market. However, small fruits were sweeter and richer in antioxidants, allowing the consumption of both natural and processed fruits. Thus, this native fruit denotes an important source of nutrients and bioactive compounds, especially iron.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While the balance weight parameters of the vehicle, including net buoyancy and the relative position between gravity center and buoyant center, have great influences on motion performance. In this paper, the influences of balance weight parameters on its motion performance in vertical plane were researched based on dynamic equations. The influence rules of these parameters on motion performance and their reasonable value ranges were provided as well. The research can provide references for the overall design, internal layout planning and trimming of the vehicle, improve its motion performance and shorten the development cycle.

Instead of being physically coupled, the modules are connected via communication links that rely on the flow of information among them, i. e. inter-module interactions are enabled by underwater communication networks at distant and close ranges and supported by visual perception at very close range. Without rigid links, the MSV can reconfigure itself and adapt in response to the shape of the terrain, including walls with negative slope. The MORPH concept requires qualitatively new behaviors such as adaptive sensor placement for perception and navigation, as well as environmental modeling in complex environments. On site view planning will lead to a solution well beyond the operational state of the art for underwater cliff surveys and other similar missions. A final demonstration on a vertical cliff, unfeasible automatically with today's technology, will validate the efficacy of the methods developed at the end of the project. {\textcopyright} IFAC.},

abstract = {Abstract In standard ROV operations a joystick command console is used for positioning control. The joystick command console controls the propeller speed of each thruster. A thrust allocation may be used for manual control in surge, sway, heave and yaw. Accurate station keeping or high precision moves require a skilled and concentrated pilot. Some ROV tasks, such as station keeping and trajectory tracking, can be automated by a closed-loop positioning control system. However, for tasks such as inspection of an unknown object or complex manipulation work, the desired trajectory is not known in advance, and must be decided by a pilot based on view from ROV cameras or other sensor data. In that case, the pilot should have an easy way of guiding the ROV without spending a lot of effort on the positioning control itself. The low level position control should be automated by a controller that compensates for ROV dynamics and environmental loads. A joystick with closed-loop control functions is proposed in this paper. Joystick inputs will generate desired velocities or positions rather than direct thruster speed commands. The control of desired states is done by a closed-loop positioning system with feedback. The methods for the proposed joystick control modes are described in this paper. Full scale experiments are presented demonstrating the performance of the joystick in closed-loop control.},

abstract = {In real-world robotics, motion planning remains to be an open challenge. Not only robotic systems are required to move through unexplored environments, but also their manoeuvrability is constrained by their dynamics and often suffer from uncertainty. One approach to overcome this problem is to incrementally map the surroundings while, simultaneously, planning a safe and feasible path to a desired goal. This is especially critical in underwater environments, where autonomous vehicles must deal with both motion and environment uncertainties. In order to cope with these constraints, this work proposes an uncertainty-based framework for mapping and planning feasible motions online with probabilistic safety-guarantees. The proposed approach deals with the motion, probabilistic safety, and online computation constraints by (i) incrementally representing the environment as a collection of local maps, and (ii) iteratively (re)planning kinodynamically-feasible and probabilistically-safe paths to goal. The proposed framework is evaluated on the Sparus II, a nonholonomic torpedo-shaped AUV, by conducting simulated and real-world trials, thus proving the efficacy of the method and its suitability even for systems with limited on-board computational power.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a simplified nonlinear fuzzy controller integrating an improved three-dimensional (3D) guidance law, in order to address the problem of path following for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exposed to unknown environmental disturbances. First, an improved 3D line-of-sight guidance law that makes full use of the essentially equivalent coordinate transformation is derived to transform 3D path following position errors into controlled guidance speeds, which also reduces the path following system form second-order to first-order. The side-slip angle and angle of attack are integrated into 3D guidance design to account for the underactuated configuration in sway and heave. Second, a nonlinear single-input fuzzy controller is designed to reduce computation complexity resulting from square rules in a double-input fuzzy controller, and to force the steerable speeds of an AUV to attain their guidance profiles. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis is adopted to suggest that the nonlinear fuzzy design with the convergent distribution and small slope for the single input have better robustness against unknown disturbances than the linear design. Finally, numerical examples with quantitative comparison are provided to illustrate the performance of the nonlinear single-input fuzzy controller for 3D path following of an underactuated AUV exposed to unknown environmental disturbances.},

abstract = {The problem of motion instability which can occur on a cruising AUV flying over a steep terrain is addressed. In order to interpret the longitudinal motion instability of a cruising AUV experienced during its near-bottom mission, a simulation model for AUV dive was developed. The model incorporates vehicle dynamics and underwater acoustic physics interacting with sea bottom and sea water. As the vehicle dynamics, closed-loop dynamic model representing the controlled motion of an actual cruising AUV is used. Dive simulation of the vehicle following a steep terrain has shown that the lost bottom lock in altimeter operation and the altitude overestimation above a steep terrain are convincing sources of the instability in vehicle motion. Directly correlated with the false altitude which may cause a bottom collision, an ongoing motion instability during a bottom-following dive indicates a vehicle is in serious danger. As a possible solution for the lost bottom lock and altitude overestimation, strategy of slope-following navigation has been exemplified.},

abstract = {Legged robots can outperform wheeled machines for most navigation tasks across unknown and rough terrains. For such tasks, visual feedback is a fundamental asset to provide robots with terrain-awareness. However, robust dynamic locomotion on difficult terrains with real-time performance guarantees remains a challenge. Indeed, the computational effort demanded by visual processing limits the potential for realtime control and planning strategies. In this paper, we present a real-time, dynamic foothold adaptation strategy based on visual feedback. Our method adjusts the landing position of the feet in a fully reactive manner, using only on-board computers and sensors. The correction is computed and executed continuously along the swing phase trajectory of each leg. To efficiently adapt the landing position, we implement a self-supervised foothold classifier based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The training set is automatically generated by a heuristic algorithm that jointly evaluates terrain morphology, kinematics, and leg collisions. Our method results in an up to 200 times faster computation with respect to the full-blown heuristics. Our goal is to react to visual stimuli from the environment, bridging the gap between blind reactive locomotion and purely vision-based planning strategies. We assess the performance of our method on the dynamic quadruped robot HyQ, executing static and dynamic gaits (at speeds up to 0.5 m/s) in both simulated and real scenarios; the benefit of safe foothold adaptation is clearly demonstrated by the overall robot behavior.},

abstract = {When the results of research in the field of robotics are presented to the scientific community, the same question is asked repeatedly: Are the results really reproducible? Regarding benchmarking issues, some technological areas where complex mechatronic devices, such as robots, have a central role are very far from other research areas like physics or chemistry, to name but a few, where reproducibility is always mandatory. Aside from mechatronic complexities, the comparison between two different algorithms in the same conditions is influenced by the experimental validation scenario. In underwater environments, the difficulties for benchmarking characterization increase substantially. This is especially true when the test bed is the sea where uncertainty is high. It is the aim of this article to present a software tool which enables a comparison between two different algorithms when the algorithms are being used to solve the same problem in water tank conditions. This is a preliminary stage before the final validation on the seabed. The evaluated algorithms fall into the three-dimensional (3-D) image reconstruction context, as a prior step to their autonomous manipulation. Performance results are presented for both simulation and real water tank conditions.},

We present in this paper development results for a complete software framework intending to make state-of-the-art and future algorithms available for routine operation. The aim is to provide a software tool able to produce 2D/3D maps from high resolution image sequences merged with navigation data in a robust and simplified process without requiring the presence of a specialist controlling the computation process. The 2D mapping technique aims to merge many thousands of multiple view, small footprint images, into a single geo-referenced mosaic that accounts for image and navigation fusion. The 3D mapping is more suitable for smaller areas and aims to reconstruct geo-referenced and scaled 3D models of sea-floor scenes from multiple image frames. Algorithms integrated to the Matisse tool have been extensively tested on several datasets and in real world trials, ensuring robust performance in numerous environmental scenarios.},

abstract = {IEEE This paper proposes the use of path-planning algorithms for hovering autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in applications where the robot needs to adapt online its trajectory for inspection or safety purposes. In particular, it proposes the platform Sparus II AUV and a set of planning algorithms to conduct these new AUV capabilities. These algorithms generate trajectories under motion constraints, which can be followed without deviations, to ensure the safety even when passing close to obstacles. View planning algorithms are also combined to decide the movements to be executed to discover the unexplored seabed or target, and to cover it with a camera or sonar. Online mapping with profiling sonars and online planning with fast sampling-based algorithms allow the execution of missions without any previous knowledge of the 3-D shape of the environment. Real 2-D results in an artificial harbor structure and simulated natural rocky canyon demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for avoiding or inspecting the underwater environment. These new AUV capabilities can be used to acquire images of the environment that can be used to inspect and map the habitat.},

Called the  {\&} {\#}x201C;Driftcam, {\&} {\#}x201D; this relatively small system has been developed to freely probe midwater acoustic-scattering layers while being used in combination with active acoustics on a nearby research vessel. The system uses a low-light video camera and illumination system installed within a polished borosilicate spherical housing. A novel buoyancy engine, using pressure feedback control, facilitates active depth correction to a maximum depth of 1500 m. Embedded computers command the camera, lighting, and depth control. The vehicle is an acoustic modem for bidirectional communication to the surface tender. Radio direction finding and an Argos satellite beacon aid in surface recovery. In addition, the system is highly portable, measuring 1.5 m in total length with a mass of 85 kg, and has the potential to increase the visual sampling of midwater communities by reducing operational costs. All aspects of the system are discussed with focus given to design, testing, and performance of the buoyancy engine. Preliminary results are also presented for deployments into scattering layers in the Guaymas Basin of the Gulf of California, Mexico, showing the utility of the Driftcam system in the field.},

This type of data is of interest to marine scientists studying benthic habitats and organisms. AUVs collect georeferenced images over an area with consistent illumination and altitude, and make it possible to generate broad scale, photo-realistic 3D maps. Marine scientists then typically spend several minutes on each of thousands of images, labeling substratum type and biota at a subset of points. Labels from four Australian research groups were combined using the CATAMI classification scheme, a hierarchical classification scheme based on taxonomy and morphology for scoring marine imagery. This data set consists of 407,968 expert labeled points from around the Australian coast, with associated images, geolocation and other sensor data. The robotic surveys that collected this data form part of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) ongoing benthic monitoring program. There is reuse potential in marine science, robotics, and computer vision research.},

abstract = {IEEE Underwater docking enables autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to operate independently of a surface vessel for extended periods. To perform the docking mission, special attention has to be paid to the navigation, guidance, and control issues of the vehicle, especially under current disturbances. Based on a full dynamic model of an AUV in currents, this paper studies the influences of current disturbances on AUV docking motion. A comprehensive docking scheme is introduced, which combines Kalman filter type navigation, guidance with current compensation, and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for both cross-track and heading control, to ensure successful docking operations. To counter the current effects, the proposed guidance algorithm applies current estimation and attitude compensation for motion correction online; in addition, an upstream control strategy in the case of strong current is also discussed. The proposed algorithms are initially validated through model-based numerical simulations, which provide effective guidance for the succeeding docking experiments conducted in a current generating pool. The feasibility and effectiveness of the countering approaches for AUV docking under current disturbances are demonstrated during the pool trials.},

abstract = {—Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are causing degrada-tion and loss of seagrass cover, often in the form of bare patches (potholes) and propeller-scaring from vessels. Degradation of seagrass habitat has increased significantly in recent years with losses totaling some 110 km 2 per year. With seagrass habitat disappearing at historically unprecedented rates, development of new tools for mapping these disturbances is critical to understanding habitat distribution and seagrass abundance. Current methods for mapping seagrass coverage rely on appropriate meteorological conditions (satellite imagery), are high in cost (aerial photography), or lack resolution (in situ point surveys). All of these methods require low turbidity, and none is capable of automatically detecting bare patches (potholes) in seagrass habitat. Sonar-based methods for mapping seagrass can function in high turbidity, and are not affected by meteorological conditions. Here, we present an automatic method for detecting and quantifying potholes in sidescan sonar images collected in a very shallow, highly disturbed seagrass bed. Acoustic studies of shallow seagrass beds ({\textless}2 m) are scarce due to traditional approaches being limited by reduced horizontal swath in these depth ranges. The main challenges associated with these sidescan sonar images are random ambient noise and uneven backscatter intensity across the image. Our method combines adaptive histogram equalization and top-hat mathematical morphology transformation to remove image noises and irregularities. Then, boundaries of potholes are detected using optimum bi-narization as well as closing and erosion mathematical morphology filters. This method was applied to several sonar images taken from the Lower Laguna Madre in Texas at less than 2-m depth. Experimental results in comparison with ground-truthing demonstrated the effectiveness method by identifying potholes with 97{\%} accuracy.

abstract = {Imagery collected by still and video cameras is an increasingly important tool for minimal impact, repeatable observations in the marine environment. Data generated from imagery includes identification, annotation and quantification of biological subjects and environmental features within an image. To be long-lived and useful beyond their project-specific initial purpose, and to maximize their utility across studies and disciplines, marine imagery data should use a standardised vocabulary of defined terms. This would enable the compilation of regional, national and/or global data sets from multiple sources, contributing to broad-scale management studies and development of automated annotation algorithms. The classification scheme developed under the Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery (CATAMI) project provides such a vocabulary. The CATAMI classification scheme introduces Australian-wide acknowledged, standardised terminology for annotating benthic substrates and biota in marine imagery. It combines coarse-level taxonomy and morphology, and is a flexible, hierarchical classification that bridges the gap between habitat/biotope characterisation and taxonomy, acknowledging limitations when describing biological taxa through imagery. It is fully described, documented, and maintained through curated online databases, and can be applied across benthic image collection methods, annotation platforms and scoring methods. Following release in 2013, the CATAMI classification scheme was taken up by a wide variety of users, including government, academia and industry. This rapid acceptance highlights the scheme's utility and the potential to facilitate broad-scale multidisciplinary studies of marine ecosystems when applied globally. Here we present the CATAMI classification scheme, describe its conception and features, and discuss its utility and the opportunities as well as challenges arising from its use.},

abstract = {Colony morphological features is among the best predictor of the scleractinian coral's function in reef ecosystems. However, morphological traits are categorical and to convert this information into a quantitative value as well as estimate their influence on ecosystem process remain a challenge. Here, we propose a trait-based approach to quantify morphological diversity and assess the structural complexity of the habitat provided by corals. We used a previously published dataset that is related to a bleaching event that affected the coral reef off Tikus Island in Indonesia in 1983. We found clear signs of recovery of the coral assemblage's complexity toward pre El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions five years after the event. Independent of the change observed in species richness, this return in structural complexity was accompanied by a global decrease in species number associated with each particular morphological entity (Functional Redundancy) and an increase in the number of single-species entities (Functional Vulnerability). Together with species loss, we show an overall functional erosion of the coral assemblage and suggest that the role of the coral reef habitat could be strongly imperiled under repeated or synergistic disturbances. This approach offers an opportunity for a better understanding of coral responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances.},

These tasks are addressed nowadays using manned submersibles or work-class remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), equipped with teleoperated arms under human supervision. In the context of the TRITON Spanish funded project, a subsea panel docking and an intervention procedure are proposed. The light-weight intervention AUV (I-AUV) Girona 500 is used to autonomously dock into a subsea panel using a funnel-based docking method for passive accommodation. Once docked, an autonomous fixed-based manipulation system, which uses feedback from a digital camera, is used to turn a valve and plug/unplug a connector. The paper presents the techniques used for the autonomous docking and manipulation as well as how the adapted subsea panel has been designed to facilitate such operations.},

abstract = {Growth and contraction of ecosystem engineers, such as trees, influence ecosystem structure and function. On coral reefs, methods to measure small changes in the structure of microhabitats, driven by growth of coral colonies and contraction of skeletons, are extremely limited. We used 3D reconstructions to quantify changes in the external structure of coral colonies of tabular Acropora spp., the dominant habitat-forming corals in shallow exposed reefs across the Pacific. The volume and surface area of live colonies increased by 21{\%} and 22{\%}, respectively, in 12 months, corresponding to a mean annual linear extension of 5.62 cm yr−1 (±1.81 SE). The volume and surface area of dead skeletons decreased by 52{\%} and 47{\%}, respectively, corresponding to a mean decline in linear extension of −29.56 cm yr−1 (±7.08 SE), which accounted for both erosion and fragmentation of dead colonies. This is the first study to use 3D photogrammetry to assess fine-scale structural changes of entire individual colonies in situ, quantifying coral growth and contraction. The high-resolution of the technique allows for detection of changes on reef structure faster than other non-intrusive approaches. These results improve our capacity to measure the drivers underpinning ecosystem biodiversity, status and trajectory.},

abstract = {Underwater image mosaicking is an important tool for visual surveys, object detection, and as a means to control the underwater robot if done online. In this paper, novel results of an spectral registration method on image data collected by a remotely operated vehicle in the Ligurian Sea are presented. The registration method computes 2D translation, rotation, and scale, along with a covariance matrix for these parameters. An appearance-based place recognition method is used to detect loops. These methods are embedded in a graph-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping framework to provide a globally consistent and optimized map of the photographed ground.},

abstract = {Although alternatives have become available, pen and ink drawings of stone tools dominate archaeological publications. Despite the existence of a conventional illustration framework, the work produced by illustrators can be inconsistent and hinges on skill level and time commitment. Discussions going back to the 1880s critically question the use of illustrations for the purpose of scientific publication. Alternatives, such as laser scanning and photogrammetric modeling, are now available for displaying lithics. These alternatives can remove the subjectivity involved in artistic rendering, creating replicable results, regardless of who is collecting the data. In addition to creating more regularized and objective representations, there are a significant number of analytical and other benefits to adopting novel imaging techniques to depict stone tools in publications. A set of three-dimensional (3D) models are presented here to demonstrate the capabilities of laser scanning and, potentially, photogrammetric modeling as replacements for lithic illustration.},

abstract = {As a precise volume of volcanic ash-plume is essential to understand the dynamic of gas emission, exchanges and the eruptive dynamics, we have measured in 3D using photogrammetry a small-size volcanic plume at the summit of Yasur Volcano, Vanuatu. The objective was to collect the altitude and planform shape of the plume as well as the vertical variations of the shape and size. To reach this objective, the authors have used the Structure from Motion photogrammetric method applied to a series of photographs captured in a very short period of time around and above the plume. A total of 146 photographs at 3000×4000 pixel were collected as well as the geolocation, the pitch, tilt and orientation of the cameras. The results revealed a "mushroom"-like shape of the plume with a narrow ascending column topped by a turbulent mixing zone. The volume of the plume was calculated to be ∼13,430m3±512m3(with the error being the cube of the linear error from the Ground Control Points) for a maximum height above the terrain of 63m. The included error was also kept high because of the irregular distribution of the Ground Control Points that could not be collected in dangerous areas due to the ongoing eruption. Based on this research, it is therefore worth investigating the usage of multiple cameras to capture plumes in 3D over time and the method is also a good complement to the recent development of photogrammetry from space, which can tackle larger-scale eruption plumes.},

The robot's joints are directly driven through control signals generated by a central pattern generator (CPG) network. A genetic algorithm is applied in order to find out an optimal combination of internal parameters of the CPG given a desired walking speed in straight line. Feedback signals generated by the robot's inertial and force sensors are directly fed into the CPG in order to automatically adjust the locomotion pattern over uneven terrain and to deal with external perturbations in real time. Omnidirectional motion is achieved by controlling the pelvis motion. The performance of the proposed control system has been assessed through simulation experiments on a NAO humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can be effectively applied to oceanographic research. However, long-term marine environment measuring is impractical for AUVs because the energy storage is limited. The objective of this paper is to develop the variable buoyancy AUVs with the capacity of landing and bottom-sitting for an extended measuring period and minimum energy consumption. In order to land safely on the expected position on the seafloor, a variable buoyancy system (VBS) has been developed for the AUVs by using water ballast. The ballast operation and landing motion of the AUVs should meet the requirements of landing position/attitude accuracy on the seafloor. The navigation procedure of an AUV for landing and taking-off involves the following steps: deployment; navigation; landing; measuring operation on the seafloor; takeoff; and return navigation. With regard to landing strategy, the bidirectional motion planning method is developed to generate the trajectory for landing on an expected location. The real AUV follows the track which the virtual AUV generates to land on the expected location. A landing controller is designed by using sliding mode fuzzy control (SMFC) technique. The simulation results show that the method performs effectively.},

abstract = {In the era of Big Data, omic-scale technologies, and increasing calls for data sharing, it is generally agreed that the use of community-developed, open data standards is critical. Far less agreed upon is exactly which data standards should be used, the criteria by which one should choose a standard, or even what constitutes a data standard. It is impossible simply to choose a domain and have it naturally follow which data standards should be used in all cases. The 'right' standards to use is often dependent on the use case scenarios for a given project. Potential downstream applications for the data, however, may not always be apparent at the time the data are generated. Similarly, technology evolves, adding further complexity. Would-be standards adopters must strike a balance between planning for the future and minimizing the burden of compliance. Better tools and resources are required to help guide this balancing act.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Malacological Society of London, all rights reserved.Deposit-feeding gastropods provide integral links between benthic productivity and higher trophic levels in a variety of aquatic environments. At high population densities these snails can exert a significant grazing impact on available microphytobenthos (MPB). Here we provide the first report on the potential ingestion rates and feeding impact of the freshwater thiarid Melanoides tuberculata. This species consists of a variety of distinct morphs that have been introduced and become invasive in many areas in the New World. We used an in situ fluorometric approach to elucidate the feeding dynamics of three M. tuberculata populations from different habitat types. Daily ingestion rates, potential daily feeding impact and per capita resource availability were calculated based on snail density and MPB biomass. The highest maximum potential ingestion rate was estimated when snails occurred at the lowest population density, where per capita resource availability was highest. Feeding impact, in terms of potential daily consumption of MPB, varied depending on gut passage time and pigment consumption/digestion efficiency. Overall, the feeding dynamics of M. tuberculata were significantly different between populations. The variation in traits related to feeding dynamics, whether plastic or adaptive, contributes to the generalist nature of M. tuberculata. It is expected that these traits facilitate invasion success, as the species is able to inhabit and persist in a range of aquatic environments under different levels of resource availability.},

abstract = {Bivalve molluscs are newly discovered models of successful aging, and this invertebrate group includes Arctica islandica, with the longest metazoan life span. Despite an increasing biogerontological focus on bivalves, their life history traits in relation to maximum age are not as comprehensively understood as those in vertebrate model aging organisms. We explore the allometric scaling of longevity and the relationship between development schedules (time to maturity and growth rate) and longevity in the Bivalvia. Using a traditional nonphylogenetic approach and the phylogenetically independent contrasts method, the relationship among these life history parameters is analyzed. It is demonstrated that in bivalves, maximum shell size, development, and growth rates all associate with longevity. Our findings support the observations of life history patterns in mammals and fish. This is the first investigation into the relationship among longevity, size, and development schedules throughout this group, and the results strengthened by the control for phylogenetic independence.},

@article{Bryson2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Habitat structural complexity is one of the most important factors in determining the makeup of biological communities. Recent advances in structure-from-motion and photogrammetry have resulted in a proliferation of 3D digital representations of habitats from which structural complexity can be measured. Little attention has been paid to quantifying the measurement errors associated with these techniques, including the variability of results under different surveying and environmental conditions. Such errors have the potential to confound studies that compare habitat complexity over space and time. This study evaluated the accuracy, precision, and bias in measurements of marine habitat structural complexity derived from structure-from-motion and photogrammetric measurements using repeated surveys of artificial reefs (with known structure) as well as natural coral reefs. We quantified measurement errors as a function of survey image coverage, actual surface rugosity, and the morphological community composition of the habitat-forming organisms (reef corals). Our results indicated that measurements could be biased by up to 7.5{\%} of the total observed ranges of structural complexity based on the environmental conditions present during any particular survey. Positive relationships were found between measurement errors and actual complexity, and the strength of these relationships was increased when coral morphology and abundance were also used as predictors. The numerous advantages of structure-from-m otion and photogrammetry techniques for quantifying and investigating marine habitats will mean that they are likely to replace traditional measurement techniques (e.g., chain-and-tape). To this end, our results have important implications for data collection and the interpretation of measurements when examining changes in habitat complexity using structure-from-motion and photogrammetry.},

@article{Sanchez-Caballero2017,
abstract = {In reefs, fish distribution and community structure are strongly linked to habitat structure. The objective of this study was to develop a baseline of the attributes of a rocky reef fish community threatened by development and their possible relationship with habitat complexity in order to assess how predicted habitat modification would impact the fish community. In the study area, the construction of a tourist marina is planned as part of a residential area with a total size of 500 ha. The project includes the translocation of corals, infilling of reclamation areas by dredging, and floating docks, which is predicted to affect both benthic rugosity and the types of benthic cover. Using hierarchical clustering based on benthic substrate type and rugosity we defined three levels of habitat complexity (Low, Medium, High). The fish community at different levels of complexity was characterized in terms of species richness, abundance, diversity and dominance, and was classified into seven trophic groups. Transects with high habitat complexity featured the highest cover of dead coral with macroalgae (43.7{\%} ± 2.3, mean ± SE) and live coral (21.0{\%} ± 1.9). There were no significant differences in rugosity among the three levels of habitat complexity (ANOVA, F = 0.145, df = 2, p = 0.87). A total of 19,799 individuals belonging to 76 species were recorded over an area of 12,000 m2. The greatest mean density and species richness occurred at high habitat complexity, with 1229.7 (±202.7) individuals per 500 m2 and 64 species, respectively. Community structure was significantly different in richness and abundance between high and low levels of complexity (p {\textless} 0.05). It is expected that the benthic habitat will be modified mainly by dredging associated with the construction of reclamation areas and the translocation of benthic organisms (mostly corals), affecting the habitat variables associated with different levels of habitat complexity in our survey. Reducing habitat complexity as a result of development is predicted to lead to a loss of species richness and ecological functions. A better understanding of the influence of habitat complexity on reef organisms can help to predict the potential impacts of habitat degradation and develop appropriate mitigation measures. Based on the results, a number of measures are suggested to detect and mitigate the expected negative impacts of construction and operation of the marina.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Operations with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have a variety of underwater applications. For example, a coordinated group of vehicles with environmental sensors can perform adaptive ocean sampling at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. We describe a methodology for cooperative control of multiple vehicles based on virtual bodies and artificial potentials (VBAP). This methodology allows for adaptable formation control and can be used for missions such as gradient climbing and feature tracking in an uncertain environment. We discuss our implementation on a fleet of autonomous underwater gliders and present results from sea trials in Monterey Bay in August, 2003. These at-sea demonstrations were performed as part of the Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN) II project. 2006 IEEE.},

However, there is still a long way to go to reach the complexity of the tasks carried out by ROV pilots. This paper proposes an intervention framework based on Learning by Demonstration (LbD) techniques in order to easily acquire the manipulation skills of a pilot and be able to reproduce similar tasks autonomously. We describe the learning algorithm as well as its interplay with the rest of the modules (navigation, perception, control) that take part in the proposed framework. We show results on a free-floating valve turning task, using Girona 500 AUV equipped with a manipulator, a passive gripper, a force/torque sensor, a camera and a haptic device to perform the demonstrations. Obtained results show the feasibility of the LbD algorithm to perform autonomous intervention even under the presence of perturbations.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the robust control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) subject to real-time constraints. A new hierarchical structure is presented, considering the strong link between the altitude and the pitch angle. Two different controllers have to be computed, both using the H∞framework. Moreover the measurement of the altitude by an ultrasonic sensor induces a non periodicity in the altitude control. To take into account this variation of the sampling interval, an LPV polytopic controller is designed whose matrices are scheduled w.r.t this parameter. Moreover the proposed design ensures a performance adaptation when the sampling interval varies. This methodology is developed for AUV, which are a difficult to control using linear tools due to strong non linearities. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFAC.},

The fieldwork and data gathering for this project was completed off the coast of the island of Malta. While in the past the data gathering process for 3D reconstructions of underwater sites has been accomplished via multiple divers and expensive photographic equipment, this project aims to automate that process. The general pipeline for creating the 3D reconstructions began with the AUV completing several low-pass missions over the site of interest (historical ship wrecks) to gather video footage from different angles. The video data was then processed through a variety of methods to generate multiple usable frames. Next, Agisoft Photoscan, a photogrammetry software, was used to create models which were stitched together or further edited for better results. Finally, the models were placed in a customdeveloped 3D rendering and visualization software. These 3D reconstructions could then be used by archaeologists for study and the creation of educational visualizations of previously unmapped and hard-To-Access archaeological sites. Educational visualizations can be used to excite the general public and encourage further funding of marine archaeology and preservation. {\textcopyright} ISCA, CATA 2017.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. Two feedback controllers are presented that utilize data averaging and model-based estimation to offset the effects of sensor noise and achieve precise control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) variable buoyancy system (VBS). Operation of the bottom skimming AUV requires a constant reaction force between the seabed and the vehicle. While performing a mission, variable seafloor topography and a changing payload weight requires the use of a VBS to maintain the reaction force. Two traits of the VBS system that make this a challenging problem are the presence of sensor noise and fast on/off actuation relative to the sensor update rate. It was discovered that both controllers function under these conditions but the model-based controller provides more precise control of the system. This paper presents a comparison between these two control algorithms based on both simulation results and field experiments in a coastal environment.},

abstract = {The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in various research, commercial and military applications has significantly increased in the recent years. Most AUVs available commercially tend to be complex and very expensive. With advances in recent technology, sensors with new functionality or lower cost substitutes have become available. Most existing AUV platforms do not facilitate easy integration of new or upgraded sensors. A solution to this problem is to have a modular AUV system with changeable payload sections capable of carrying different sensor to suite different missions. Modular AUVs are exceptionally useful in group mission scenarios with different AUVs carrying different sensor payloads. By having a team of modular AUVs, payloads can be easily interchanged between the AUVs to configure the team for various missions. Modular AUVs require their sections to be electrically and mechanically compatible with one another. In this paper we describe the detailed architecture of the electronics system for STARFISH AUV. The benefits of modular hardware and its advantages in developing and integrating newer sensor payloads with the base AUV are shown. The modular electronics system for STARFISH AUV has been implemented and currently being tested.},

Fault-tolerant reconfiguration is obtained using the virtual actuator approach, Steffen (2005). The paper investigates properties of a centralised versus a decentralised implementation and assesses the capabilities under communication constraints between the individual robots. In the centralised case, each robot sends information related to its own status to a unique virtual actuator that computes the necessary reconfiguration. In the decentralised case, each robot is equipped with its own virtual actuator that is able to accommodate both local faults and faults within a collaborating unit. The paper discusses how this is done through exploiting structural information (e.g. thruster configuration) for each participant in the cooperation. A test scenario is presented as a case in which an underwater drill needs to be transported and positioned by three collaborating robots as part of an underwater autonomous operation.},

Unlike an aerial environ-ment, an underwater environment contains larger particles and is dominated by a different image degradation model. Our method starts with a thorough understanding of underwater particle physics (e.g., forward, back, multiple scattering, blur and noise). Targeting underwater image enhancement in a real-world application, we include an artificial light model in the derivation. The proposed method is effective for both color and gray images with substantial improvement in the process time compared to conventional methods. The proposed method is validated by using simulated synthetic images (color) and real-world underwater images (color and grayscale). Using two underwater image sets acquired from the same area but with different water turbidity, we evaluate the proposed visibility enhancement and camera registration improvement in SLAM.},

Our algorithm automatically builds a suitable connected graph of keyposes and constraints, dynamically selects inner and outer window membership and optimises both simultaneously. We demonstrate in extensive simulation experiments that our method approaches the accuracy of offline bundle adjustment while maintaining constant-time operation, even in the hard case of very loopy monocular camera motion. Furthermore, we present a set of real experiments for various types of visual sensor and motion, including large scale SLAM with both monocular and stereo cameras, loopy local browsing with either monocular or RGB-D cameras, and dense RGB-D object model building.},

abstract = {Pseudoreplication is deﬁned as the use of inferential statistics to test for treat-ment effects where treatments are not replicated and/or replicates are not statis-tically independent. It is a genuine but controversial issue in ecologyparticularly in the case of costly landscape-scale manipulations, behavioral stud-ies where ethics or other concerns may limit sample sizes, ad hoc monitoringdata, and the analysis of natural experiments where chance events occur at asingle site. Here key publications on the topic are reviewed to illustrate thedebate that exists about the conceptual validity of pseudoreplication. A surveyof ecologists and case studies of experimental design and publication issues areused to explore the extent of the problem, ecologists' solutions, reviewers' atti-tudes, and the fate of submitted manuscripts. Scientists working across a rangeof ecological disciplines regularly come across the problem of pseudoreplicationand build solutions into their designs and analyses. These include carefullydeﬁning hypotheses and the population of interest, acknowledging the limits ofstatistical inference and using statistical approaches including nesting and ran-dom effects. Many ecologists face considerable challenges getting their workpublished if accusations of pseudoreplication are made – even if the problemhas been dealt with. Many reviewers reject papers for pseudoreplication, andthis occurs more often if they haven't experienced the issue themselves. Theconcept of pseudoreplication is being applied too dogmatically and often leadsto rejection during review. There is insufﬁcient consideration of the associatedphilosophical issues and potential statistical solutions. By stopping the publica-tion of ecological studies, reviewers are slowing the pace of ecological researchand limiting the scope of management case studies, natural events studies, andvaluable data available to form evidence-based solutions. Recommendations forfair and consistent treatment of pseudoreplication during writing and revieware given for authors, reviewers, and editors.},

abstract = {Experiments carried out by a combined team of the Ca' Foscari and IUAV Universities of Venice, on ancient shipwrecks with different characteristics in different environments (shallow water cargoes of marble stones and a deep water mound of amphoras), confirm the potential of three-dimensional surveys in documenting underwater archaeological sites. Multi-image photogrammetry is the principal and innovative technique used, but we have confirmed the necessity of accompanying this new system with a precise topographical net. This last aspect is particularly evident when it is necessary to solve the problem of the documentation of a multi-strata mound of amphoras, anchoring 3D models of each stratum as it is removed. Photogrammetric models must be processed with 3D software modelling to interpret the textured meshes and to construct polygonal models, selecting the important aspects of the objects, and eliminating the ‘noise' of the point cloud. The 3D model can easily be used to reconstruct the original arrangement of the cargo, on which it is then possible to make various calculations and considerations of nautical engineering.},

abstract = {While the most accurate solution to off-line structure from motion (SFM) problems is undoubtedly to extract as much correspondence information as possible and perform global optimisation, sequential methods suitable for live video streams must approximate this to fit within fixed computational bounds. Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM - also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) - have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.},

This autonomy is used to carry out undersea target reacquisition missions that would otherwise be impossible with a low-cost platform. The AUV requires only simple sensors and operates without navigation equipment such as Doppler Velocity Log, inertial navigation or acoustic beacons. Demonstrations of the capability show that the vehicle can carry out the task in an ocean environment. The system includes a forward looking sonar and a set of simple vehicle sensors. The functionality includes feature tracking using a graphical square root smoothing SLAM algorithm, global localization using multiple EKF estimators, and knowledge adaptive mission execution. The global localization incorporates a unique robust matching criteria which utilizes both positive and negative information. Separate match hypotheses are maintained by each EKF estimator allowing all matching decisions to be reversible.},

A novel RGB-D camera providing color and depth information is used. Robustness is achieved by embedding the motion estimation in a Bayesian framework. The involved probability distributions are modeled based on empirical data. In extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets the superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed in comparison to previous implementations is validated. Furthermore, experiments on a quadrocopter demonstrate the suitability of the approach for stable motion estimation in realtime control loops.},

Many variants of these techniques have started to make an impact in a wide range of applications, including robot navigation and augmented reality. However, despite some remarkable results in these areas, most SfM and visual SLAM techniques operate based on the assumption that the observed environment is static. However, when faced with moving objects, overall system accuracy can be jeopardized. In this article, we present for the first time a survey of visual SLAM and SfM techniques that are targeted toward operation in dynamic environments. We identify three main problems: how to perform reconstruction (robust visual SLAM), how to segment and track dynamic objects, and how to achieve joint motion segmentation and re-construction. Based on this categorization, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing approaches. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each solution class are critically discussed from the perspective of practicality and robustness.},

abstract = {The Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) designed at the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Canterbury is in an early stage of development. With the design of the AUV completed, the primary focus now is to design control software. The control software has to be able to stabilize the vehicle at a desired position and let the vehicle follow a desired trajectory within a reasonable error. The AUV is able to operate in six degrees of freedom and the dynamics of an AUV are nonlinear and subjected to a variety of disturbances. A kinematic and dynamic model of the AUV is derived for the six degrees of freedom operating range. The degrees of freedom are decoupled, where only the surge, heave and yaw degrees of freedom will be controlled. A system identification approach is proposed to estimate unknown mass/inertia and damping parameters, treating the surge, heave and yaw degrees of freedom separately. Unfortunately due to sensor malfunctioning the unknown mass/inertia and damping terms could not be estimated, a parameter selection method is used instead. The parameter selection is based on parameter estimation results of software programs and a parameter comparison with other similar shaped AUVs. A feedback linearizing control technique is chosen to design control laws for control in the surge, heave and yaw degrees of freedom. The controller performed well under parameter perturbation and noise contamination on the feedback position and velocity signals. An under-actuated control problem arises in x-y plane, since one is only able to control two degrees of freedom while the AUV has three degrees of freedom. To steer the AUV smoothly, a path planning model is derived, which describes a path from A to B with the use of polar coordinates. It works as expected, except for planning a straight line trajectory due to singularity reasons. iv The under-actuated control problem is again investigated, assuming sway motion of the AUV is not negligible, so Coriolis and centripetal forces need to be considered. A state feedback control method is explained, which is able to follow a reference trajectory in the x-y plane. The only disadvantage is that the yaw degree of freedom of the reference trajectory needs to be persistently exciting, which makes following a straight line impossible.},

abstract = {Annual coral bleaching events, which are pre-dicted to occur as early as the next decade in the Florida Keys, are expected to cause catastrophic coral mortality. Despite this, there is little field data on how Caribbean coral communities respond to annual thermal stress events. At Cheeca Rocks, an inshore patch reef near Islamorada, FL, the condition of 4234 coral colonies was followed over 2 yr of subsequent bleaching in 2014 and 2015, the two hottest summers on record for the Florida Keys. In 2014, this site experienced 7.7 degree heating weeks (DHW) and as a result 38.0{\%} of corals bleached and an additional 36.6{\%} were pale or partially bleached. In situ temperatures in summer of 2015 were even warmer, with the site experiencing 9.5 DHW. Despite the increased thermal stress in 2015, only 12.1{\%} of corals were bleached in 2015, which was 3.1 times less than 2014. Partial mortality dropped from 17.6{\%} of surveyed corals to 4.3{\%} between 2014 and 2015, and total colony mortality declined from 3.4 to 1.9{\%} between years. Total colony mortality was low over both years of coral bleaching with 94.7{\%} of colonies surviving from 2014 to 2016. The reduction in bleaching severity and coral mortality associated with a second stronger thermal anomaly provides evidence that the response of Caribbean coral communities to annual bleaching is not strictly temperature dose dependent and that acclimatization responses may be possible even with short recovery periods. Whether the results from Cheeca Rocks represent an aberration or a true resilience potential is the subject of ongoing research.},

abstract = {The availability of habitat structure across spatial scales can determine ecological organization and resilience. However, anthropogenic disturbances are altering the abundance and composition of habitat-forming organisms. How such shifts in the composition of these organisms alter the physical structure of habitats across ecologically important scales remains unclear. At a time of unprecedented coral loss and homogenization of coral assemblages globally, we investigate the inherent structural complexity of taxonomically distinct reefs, across five ecologically relevant scales of measurement (4–64 cm). We show that structural complexity was influenced by coral species composition, and was not a simple function of coral cover on the studied reefs. However, inter-habitat variation in structural complexity changed with scale. Importantly, the scales at which habitat structure was available also varied among habitats. Complexity at the smallest, most vulnerable scale (4 cm) varied the most among habitats, which could have inferences for as much as half of all reef fishes which are small-bodied and refuge dependent for much of their lives. As disturbances continue and species shifts persist, the future of these ecosystems may rely on a greater concern for the composition of habitat-building species and prioritization of particular configurations for protection of maximal cross-scale habitat structural complexity.},

Because of the size and shape of this structure, the ECF will alter local flowhydraulic conditions and isolate local discharges and intakes from free interaction with the open water of the harbour. To investigate the impact and functionality of the ECF, a three- dimensional (3D) hydraulic model was adopted in this study. The model was verified against vertical velocity profiles measured with an acoustic doppler current profiler in the study region. Results of the verification reveal that under the driving force of wind, the best agreement between simulated and measured currents occurs in the surface layer. Considering the complex nature of the hydraulic conditions in the harbour, the model performs reasonably well. Overall, the model should provide a useful tool considering and comparing hydraulic con- ditions under different ECF configurations and the existing condition.

abstract = {This article presents methods applied for automated detection of fish based on cascade classifiers of Haar-like features created using underwater images from a remotely operated vehicle under ocean survey conditions. The images are unconstrained, and the imaging environment is highly variable due to the moving imaging platform, a complex rocky seabed background, and still and moving cryptic fish targets. These images are released in a new image dataset, "labeled fishes in the wild," of in situ groundfishes, mainly rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) and other associated species. The dataset includes an annotated training and validation image set, as well as an independent test video image sequence. Several Haar cascades are developed from the training set and applied to the validation and test video images for evaluation. Based on performance evaluation using the validation set, true positive detection rates of 63 to 89{\%} were achieved for seven classifiers. True positive detection rates for the test video were 66{\%} to 81{\%} for analyst-confirmed fish targets. Detector performance is dependent on training data, training and detection parameters, fish orientation, range to target, variable light intensity and attenuation.},

abstract = {Global climate change is altering community composition across many ecosystems due to nonrandom species turnover, typically characterized by the loss of specialist species and increasing similarity of biological communities across spatial scales. As anthropogenic disturbances continue to alter species composition globally, there is a growing need to identify how species responses influence the establishment of dis- tinct assemblages, such that management actions may be appropriately assigned. Here, we use trait-based analyses to compare temporal changes in five complemen- tary indices of reef fish assemblage structure among six taxonomically distinct coral reef habitats exposed to a system-wide thermal stress event. Our results revealed increased taxonomic and functional similarity of previously distinct reef fish assem- blages following mass coral bleaching, with changes characterized by subtle, but sig- nificant, shifts toward predominance of small-bodied, algal-farming habitat generalists. Furthermore, while the taxonomic or functional richness of fish assem- blages did not change across all habitats, an increase in functional originality indi- cated an overall loss of functional redundancy. We also found that prebleaching coral composition better predicted changes in fish assemblage structure than the magnitude of coral loss. These results emphasize how measures of alpha diversity can mask important changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems as assemblages reorganize. Our findings also highlight the role of coral species compo- sition in structuring communities and influencing the diversity of responses of reef fishes to disturbance. As new coral species configurations emerge, their desirability will hinge upon the composition of associated species and their capacity to maintain key ecological processes in spite of ongoing disturbances.},

abstract = {Recent efforts to monitor the health of coral reefs have highlighted the benefits of using structure from motion-based assessments, and despite increasing use of this technique in ecology and geomorphology, no study has attempted to quantify the precision of this technique over time and across different observers. This study determined whether 3D models of an ecologically relevant reef structure, the coral bommie, could be constructed using structure from motion and be reliably used to measure bommie volume and surface area between different observers and over time. We also determined whether the number of images used to construct a model had an impact on the final measurements. Three dimensional models were constructed of over twenty coral bommies from Heron Island, a coral cay at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. This study did not detect any significant observer effect, and there were no significant differences in measurements over four sampling days. The mean measurement error across all bommies and between observers was 15  2{\%} for volume measurements and 12  1{\%} for surface area measurements. There was no relationship between the number of pictures taken for a reconstruction and the measurements from that model, however, more photographs were necessary to be able to reconstruct complete coral bommies larger than 1 m3. These results suggest that structure from motion is a viable tool for ongoing monitoring of ecologically-significant coral reefs, especially to establish effects of disturbances, provided the measurement error is considered.},

To promote an ongoing ‘democratization' of acoustical imaging of shallow water environments, methods to carry out geometric and radiometric correction and georectification of sonar echograms are presented, based on simplified models for sonar-target geometry and acoustic backscattering and attenuation in shallow water. Procedures are described for automated removal of the acoustic shadows, identification of bed-water interface for situations when the water is too turbid or turbulent for reliable depth echosounding, and for automated bed substrate classification based on singlebeam full-waveform analysis. These methods are encoded in an open-source and freely-available software package, which should further facilitate use of recreational-grade sidescan sonar, in a fully automated and objective manner. The sequential correction, mapping, and analysis steps are demonstrated using a data set from a shallow freshwater environment.},

abstract = {Coral community composition varies considerably due to both environmental conditions and disturbance histories. However, the extent to which coral composition influences associated fish assemblages remains largely unknown. Here an ecological trait-based ordination analysis was used to compare functional richness (range of unique trait combinations), functional evenness (weighted distribution of fishes with shared traits), and functional divergence (proportion of total abundance supported by species with traits on the periphery of functional space) of fish assemblages among six distinct coral habitats. Despite no significant variation in species richness among habitats, there were differences in the functional richness and functional divergence, but not functional evenness, of fish assemblages among habitats. Structural complexity of coral assemblages was the best predictor of the differences in functional richness and divergence among habitats. Functional richness of fish assemblages was highest in branching Porites habitats, lowest in Pocillopora and soft coral habitats, and intermediate in massive Porites, staghorn Acropora, and mixed coral habitats. Massive and branching Porites habitats displayed greater functional divergence in fish assemblages than the Pocillopora habitat, whilst the remaining habitats were intermediate. Differences in functional richness and divergence were largely driven by the presence of small schooling planktivores in the massive and branching Porites habitats. These results indicate that differential structural complexity among coral communities may act as an environmental filter, affecting the distribution and abundance of associated species traits, particularly those of small-bodied schooling fishes.},

abstract = {— This paper introduces an optimization-based framework for robust multilegged walking motion planning. Many previous approaches use fixed gait sequences, and rely on Zero Moment Point (ZMP) to guarantee dynamic stability. While this combination works well on flat ground, it does not generalize to locomotion on uneven ground requiring aggressive gait or gait transition. To overcome such difficulty, in this paper, we present an optimization framework, that can plan both the contact location and gait sequence through a mixed-integer convex optimization program, so as to incorporate gait transition. Moreover, we rely on the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) stability criterion, which generalizes the Zero Moment Point criterion to uneven terrain with friction cone constraints, and we plan the center of mass motion, together with the angular momentum through a convex optimization program. Our approach is successfully tested on a LittleDog quadruped over simulated scenarios, including where a ZMP planner would fail, always resulting on robust walking motions.},

abstract = {We propose an information-theoretic planning ap- proach that enables mobile robots to autonomously construct dense 3D maps in a computationally efficient manner. In- spired by prior work, we accomplish this task by formulating an information-theoretic objective function based on Cauchy- Schwarz quadratic mutual information (CSQMI) that guides robots to obtain measurements in uncertain regions of the map. We then contribute a two stage approach for active mapping. First, we generate a candidate set of trajectories using a combina- tion of global planning and generation of local motion primitives. From this set, we choose a trajectory that maximizes the information-theoretic objective. Second, we employ a gradient- based trajectory optimization technique to locally refine the chosen trajectory such that the CSQMI objective is maximized while satisfying the robot's motion constraints. We evaluated our approach through a series of simulations and experiments on a ground robot and an aerial robot mapping unknown 3D environments. Real-world experiments suggest our approach reduces the time to explore an environment by 70{\%} compared to a closest frontier exploration strategy and 57{\%} compared to an information-based strategy that uses global planning, while simulations demonstrate the approach extends to aerial robots with higher-dimensional state.},

abstract = {3D visual mapping of the seafloor has found applications ranging from environment monitoring and survey of marine minerals to underwater archaeology and inspection of modern artificial structures. However, the attenuation of light is significantly more pronounced in water than in air or in space, and so in order to obtain underwater images in colour, it is typically necessary to be within 2–3 m of the seafloor. In addition to the high risk of collision when operating underwater vehicles at such low altitudes, the limited area of the seafloor covered in each image means large area surveys require a significant investment of time. In this research, we aim to increase the efficiency of mapping large areas of the seafloor by developing an underwater imaging system that can take colour images at ranges of more than 10 m, so that each image can cover a larger area, together with the necessary algorithms to automatically process the data it obtains. The system was deployed to map artificial hydrothermal vents in Iheya North field using the ROV Hyper-Dolphin in October 2012. The surveyed area is of particular interest to the research community, as multiple artificial vent holes were drilled during a mission in 2010, which locally impacted the flow of hydrothermal fluids. In this paper, we describe the methods used to process the data that the imaging system obtains and demonstrate how the mapping data can be used in quantitative studies of the seafloor. Habitats of Shinkaia crosnieri squat lobsters, which are abundant in the hydrothermally active areas, are identified in the maps and their population density calculated, and the amount of hydrothermal deposits that have grown on the artificial vent is derived from the mapping data. The work demonstrates how 3D visual mapping can be applied to benthic biology and geological studies.},

The algorithm then uses the rolled out versions of a series of consecutively taken photos to generate a mosaic showing the entire pipe in a single picture based on the recognition of sparse, structural features. The performance of the algorithm was verified in land based experiments and the robustness of the system to measurement inaccuracy was assessed. Finally two mosaicked images were created for different paths taken through the pipe, to demonstrate that the system is capable of generating the same image, regardless of the path taken by the AUV.},

abstract = {3D visual mapping of the seafloor has found applications ranging from environment monitoring and survey of marine minerals to underwater archaeology and inspection of modern man-made structures. However, the attenuation of light is significantly more pronounced in water than in air or in space, and so in order to obtain underwater images in colour, it is typically necessary to be within 2 to 3 m of the seafloor. In addition to the high risk of collision when operating underwater vehicles at such low altitudes, the limited area of the seafloor covered in each image means large area surveys require a huge investment of time. In this research, we aim to increase the efficiency of mapping large areas of the seafloor by developing an underwater imaging system that can take colour images at ranges of up to 12 m, so that each image can cover a larger area, together with the necessary algorithms to automatically process the data it obtains. The system was applied multiple times at sea, among others during two research cruises to the hydrothermally active Iheya-North field in the Okinawa Trough, which took place in October 2012 and January 2014. Data from these two surveys allows assessment of changes in the environment that occurred during 15 months. During the time between the two surveys deposits from the hydrothermal fluids grew into small chimneys on top of a man-made hydrothermal vent, providing a measure of the hydrothermal activity. These deposits were mapped with the 3D mapping system and based on that the deposited volume was computed and the average growth rate calculated.},

abstract = {Restoring underwater image from a single image is know to be ill-posed, and some assumptions made in previous methods are not suitable for many situations. In this paper, we propose a method based on blue-green channels dehazing and red channel correction for underwater image restoration. Firstly, blue-green channels are recovered via dehazing algorithm based on an extension and modification of Dark Channel Prior algorithm. Then, red channel is corrected following the Gray-World assumption theory. Finally, in order to resolve the problem which some recovered image regions may look too dim or too bright, an adaptive exposure map is built. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method significantly improves visibility and contrast, and reduces the effects of light absorption and scattering. For quantitative analysis, our results obtain best values in terms of entropy, local feature points and average gradient, which outperform three existing physical model available methods.},

abstract = {Seafloor Massive Sulfides (SMS), which were formed by deposition of precipitates from hydrothermal fluids vented from seafloor, is one of unconventional mineral resources beneath deep seafloors in the world. The authors have proposed the concept of seafloor mineral processing for development of SMS, where useful minerals included in SMS ores are separated on seafloor to be lifted while the remaining gangue is disposed on seafloor in appropriate ways. To apply column flotation, one of conventional methods in mineral processing, to seafloor mineral processing, the authors carried out simulating experiments of column flotation on deep seafloor using ores including copper, iron, lead and zinc as metallic elements. Prior to the experiments at high pressures, preparatory experiments at the atmospheric pressure were carried out to find out the optimum condition of the properties of pulp, a mixture of feed ore, water and chemical reagents. In flotation experiments at high pressures, formation and overflow of froth layer by bubbling were observed at 1MPa in both of pulps with pure water and artificial seawater. The analytical data showed that the concentration of metallic elements such as copper and zinc in the concentrates recovered from the experiments was higher than that in the feed ores while the concentration of silicon and calcium, which are assigned to gangue, in the concentrates was lower than that in the feed ores. These results suggest that column flotation can be applied to operation on seafloor. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 by ASME.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

Since then many industrial and academical applications emerged, such as the computation of mitered offset curves, automatic roof construction, solving fold-and-cut problems and the reconstruction of surfaces, to name the most prominent ones. However, there is a significant gap between the most efficient straight-skeleton algorithms and imple- mentations, on one hand, and the best knownlower runtime bounds on the other hand. The primary goal of this thesis is the development of an algorithmthat is suitable for implemen- tation and efficient in terms of time and space in order to make the advantages of straight skeletons available to real-world applications. We start with investigations concerning upper and lower bounds on the number of so- called flip events that occur in the triangulation-based straight-skeleton algorithm by Aich- holzer and Aurenhammer. In particular, we prove the existence of Steiner triangulations that are free of flip events. This result motivates a novel straight-skeleton algorithm for non-degenerate simple polygons that is based on the so-called motorcycle graph. In order to extend this algorithmto arbitrary planar straight-line graphs,we carefully generalize the motorcycle graph. This generalization leads to practical and theoretical applications: Firstly, we obtain an extension of the alternative characterization of straight skeletons by Cheng and Vigneron to planar straight-line graphs. Secondly, this characterization motivates a straight-skeleton algorithm that is based on 3D graphics hardware. Thirdly, the general- ized motorcycle graph leads to a wavefront-type straight-skeleton algorithm for arbitrary planar straight-line graphs. Our algorithm is easy to implement, has a theoretical worst- case time complexity of O(n2 log n) and operates in O(n) space. Extensive runtime tests with our implementation Bone exhibit an actual runtime of O(n log n) on a database con- taining more than 13 500 datasets of different characteristics. In practice, this constitutes an improvement of a linear factor in time and space compared to the current state-of-the-art straight-skeleton code, which is shipped with the CGAL library. In particular, Bone per- forms up to 100 times faster than the current CGAL code on datasets with a few thousand vertices, requires significant less memory and accepts more general input. Our straight-skeleton algorithm motivates the investigation of motorcycle graphs and their practical computation. We start with stochastic considerations of the average length of a motorcycles trace. The results obtained motivate a simple yet fast algorithm that employs geometric hashing. Runtime tests with our implementation Moca exhibit an O(n log n) runtime on the vast majority of our datasets. Finally, we revisit the geometric relation of straight skeletons and motorcycle graph. We present an algorithm that constructs planar straight-line graphs whose straight skeleton approximates any given motorcycle graph to an arbitrary precision. This algorithm finally leads to a P-completeness proof for straight skeletons of polygons with holes that is based on the P-completeness of motorcycle graphs.},

In order to facilitate the operability of the platform some kind of autonomy or, at least, wireless connection is required for the robot control. Radiofrequency is not suitable for underwater applications and a buoy had to be developed in order to communicate with operation and control central panel. From the buoy, a wireless access point connects the robot electronics with the control laptop through an Ethernet Serial converter. A video system consisting of an IP camera and software has been developed in order to have visual information from the robot work environment. A lightning system has been added to improve underwater visibility. All the software and control system of the platform was developed and adapted for the new communication tools using LabView{\textregistered}. Data safety has been implemented using checksum verifications and the employed bandwidth has been optimized according to the signal boost. Some tests for the video system where developed and some image processing tasks were implemented in order to show the goodness and stability of the system. A multidisciplinary team has been working for several years to develop this robot.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a biomechatronic knee prosthesis for transfemoral amputees. This kind of prostheses are considered `intelligent' because they are able to automatically adapt their response at the knee axis, as a natural knee does. This behavior is achieved by characterizing the amputee's gait through the signals captured with instrumentation of a prosthesis, which provides feedback about its current state along the gait cycle and therefore responds with the corresponding control action. In this case, unlike other commercially available intelligent knee prostheses, gait cycle characterization is based on accelerometers signals processed by an events detection algorithm. Two intelligent control strategies are presented: a bio-inspired approach, that consists of using a central pattern generator to generate a knee angle reference to be followed by the prosthesis during walking, and an adaptive scheme, that applies a control action proportional to the knee angle according to an auto-adaptive parameter dependant on gait speed. The mechanical design of the prosthesis is also presented, showing the knee joint mechanism and part of the manufacturing process. Results obtained from walking tests with both able body and amputees are shown, demonstrating the positive performance of the prosthesis in several aspects. Future works aimed at a finished product are also stated.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to generate a virtual knee angle reference to be followed by a knee prosthesis control, using an adaptive central pattern generator (CPG). Also, to study the feasibility of this approach to implement a continuous control strategy on the prosthesis. Design/methodology/approach: A CPG based on amplitude controlled phase oscillators (ACPOs) to track the current percentage of gait cycle on the prosthesis is proposed. Then, the virtual knee angle reference is generated along gait cycle, by interpolation with the corresponding angle of a sound knee. The structure and coupling of the CPG, as well as the control strategy are presented. Findings: The coupling of the CPG with real gait on the prosthesis was proven, regardless of gait speed. Also, it was found that the maximum knee angle reached during walking is proportional to gait speed. Finally, generation of virtual knee angle reference to be followed by a prosthesis is demonstrated. Research limitations/implications: As only one event detected along gait cycle was used to update the CPG phase, the response to gait speed changes might be slow. Updating the CPG with more events remains for a future work. Practical implications: The coupling of the CPG with real gait on the prosthesis results in a continuous gait cycle tracker, useful for any control strategy to be applied. Originality/value: It is the first time a bio-inspired concept as CPGs is applied to the prosthetic field. This could mean the beginning of a new era of cybernetic prostheses, which reproduce the lost limb and also the control functions of it. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The ACPO phases are passed through a parametric function which transforms them into the desired rectangular leg trajectories. Another parametric function generates a normalized force reference for each leg, which is employed to compute three different desired Center of Gravity (COG). Those references were used to enhance platform static stability margin (SSM), by the addition of a simple PI controller and ground contact forces measurements. Simulations were performed using a dynamic robot simulator (Webots) for a quadruped and hexapod platform, and a real quadruped platform with 3-DOF per leg was also used.

Social learning might be less costly than asocial learning and allow the rapid accumulation of learned traits across generations. How- ever, the benefits of social learning in a small population of individuals relying on local interactions and experiencing environmental change are not well understood yet. In this study, we used agent-based simulations to address this issue by comparing the performance of social learning to asocial learning and innate behavior, in both a static and a changing environment. Learning was modeled using neural networks, and innate behavior was modeled using geneti- cally coded behaviors. The performance of 10 mobile simulated agents was measured under three environmental scenarios: static, abrupt change and gradual change. We found that social learning allows for a better performance (in terms of survival) than asocial learning in static and abrupt-change scenarios. In contrast, when changes are gradual, social learning delays achieving the correct alter- native, while asocial learning facilitates innovation; interestingly, a mixed population (social and asocial learners) performs the best.},

However, it is necessary a locomotion system for planning in advance future footholds, and to modify the robot gait in order to maintain the platform stability. Several locomotion systems have been developed for rectangular hexapod robots, in this work a system for radially a symmetric hexapod robot is presented. It includes a module for planning the next foothold, which takes information from the robot motion and terrain obstacles, and send signals to the global controller with the modifications needed on legs trajectories. These actions demand a new coordination between moving legs, while maintaining stability. The described system was coupled with two gait pattern generators for legs coordination over terrains with forbidden zones. The locomotion system was tested on a circular hexapod robot model using a dynamic simulation software. Results from simulations show that the proposed algorithm worked successfully, with a less than 1{\%} of error.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME. Due to depletion of on-shore and superficial oil reservoirs, and impulsed by recent discoveries of oil reservoirs in off-shore ultra-deep waters, each of the processes and equipment in oil production required further improvements in order to save costs, space and to reduce weight off-shore. One way to accomplish this is without separators and with the use of online multiphase flowmeters. The most used flowmeter is the Venturi tube. Despite Venturi flowmeters having been used in almost all commercial multiphase flowmeters, there is not a single correlation that provides good results for predicting mass flow in each phase, for any flow pattern, mass quality, void fraction and/or fluids properties. Instead, many correlations have been published, based on experimental and/or field data, but the use of these correlations outside multiphase range conditions is doubtful. This study proposes a new methodology that uses genetic algorithms to find correlations that better fit a set of data, which allow determining the mass flow of a two-phase mix through a Venturi tube. For that purpose, binary trees and Pr{\"{u}}fer encoding are used to accomplish this implementation. The correlations found in this new methodology provide lower values of RMS error, 1-3{\%}, against correlations proposed by previous authors that show an RMS error range of 5-10{\%}. This technique allows finding further correlations, regardless the number of parameters to be used, at a low computational cost, and it does not require previous information on the behaviour of the data.},

abstract = {For sessile organisms such as reef-building corals, differences in the degree of dispersion of individuals across a landscape may result from important differences in life-history strategies or may reflect patterns of habitat availability. Descriptions of spatial patterns can thus be useful not only for the identification of key biological and physical mechanisms structuring an ecosystem, but also by providing the data necessary to generate and test ecological theory. Here, we used an in situ imaging technique to create large-area photomosaics of 16 plots at Palmyra Atoll, central Pacific, each covering 100 m2 of benthic habitat. We mapped the location of 44,008 coral colonies and identified each to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Using metrics of spatial dispersion, we tested for departures from spatial randomness. We also used targeted model fitting to explore candidate processes leading to differences in spatial patterns among taxa. Most taxa were clustered and the degree of clustering varied by taxon. A small number of taxa did not significantly depart from randomness and none revealed evidence of spatial uniformity. Importantly, taxa that readily fragment or tolerate stress through partial mortality were more clustered. With little exception, clustering patterns were consistent with models of fragmentation and dispersal limitation. In some taxa, dispersion was linearly related to abundance, suggesting density dependence of spatial patterning. The spatial patterns of stony corals are non-random and reflect fundamental life-history characteristics of the taxa, suggesting that the reef landscape may, in many cases, have important elements of spatial predictability.},

abstract = {California implemented the State's first network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within the nearshore waters of the northern Channel Islands in 2003. These protections serve as a tool to help ensure the long-term sustainability of marine populations and act as a living laboratory to better understand outside impacts on marine life. California's network operates synergistically to meet the objectives that a single reserve might not. In 2006 and 2007, NOAA expanded this network of thirteen MPAs into the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's deeper waters, at the time, making them the largest integrated system of MPAs of the continental United States. Historically, marine habitats around the Channel Islands were well surveyed by scuba divers to a depth of 20 meters, but the deeper waters remained poorly studied. Together, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE) developed a long-term Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) program to monitor the changes these MPAs show over time. ROV configuration, survey design and protocols, as well as data post processing and analysis techniques, were developed to specifically evaluate how marine populations respond to the establishment of a network of MPAs.},

abstract = {The Swedish Pompeii Project started in 2000 as a research and fieldwork activity initiated by the Swedish Institute in Rome. The aim was to record and analyze an entire Pompeian cityblock, Insula V 1. Since autumn 2011 a new branch of advanced digital archaeology, involving 3D reconstructions and documentation methods, was added to the project agenda. The insula was completely digitized using laser scanner technology and the raw data were employed to develop different research activities in the area of digital visualization. This paper presents the recent results of the 3D interpretation of the house of Caecilius Iucundus. This research activity was developed employing a large variety of historical and archaeological sources such as: archaeological reports, historical image documentation (printed as well as in edited material) and analysis of the in situ structures. This work was characterized by the experimentation of a new workflow of data development, where the elaboration of the interpreted structures took place directly in virtual space, using the scanned model as geometrical reference. This method easily connected all the historical and archaeological sources collected for the interpretation, opening a new discussion about different possible interpretation of the house. Moreover, a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) was used in different occasions as platform where the different hypotheses could be discussed in the context given by the actual state of the archaeological structures. The use of an accurate and resolute replica of the site as a backdrop for the virtual reconstruction allowed a high level of control on the proposed hypotheses during the interpretation process. This study enabled the acquisition of new and important information about the house, thus, bringing a significant contribution to the archaeological analysis of Insula V 1, suggested as pilot project for wider use.},

abstract = {Archaeological practice within the European context of heritage management is facing huge challenges in ways of recording and reproduction of ex-situ preserved sites. As a consequence of the Valletta-treaty, numbers of archived images and drawings of excavated structures as prime sources of past human activity, are exponentially growing. Contrarily to portable remains however, their future study and revision is biased by the two-dimensional character of the recorded data, rendering difficult their future reconstruction for new study or public dissemination. A more realistic three-dimensional (3D) way of recording and archiving should be pursued. In this paper the possibilities for 3D registration of archaeological features are examined in a computer vision-based approach using the PhotoScan software package (Agisoft LCC). It proved to be a scientific and cost-effective improvement compared to traditional documentation methods. Advantages can be found in the high accuracy and straightforwardness of the methodology. The extraction of an orthophoto or a Digital Terrain Model from the 3D model makes it feasible to integrate detailed and accurate information into the digital archaeological excavation plan. The visual character of 3D surface modeling offers enhanced output-possibilities allowing a better documentation of in-situ structures for future research and a higher public participation and awareness for the archaeological heritage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Coral reefs play a key role in coastal protection and habitat provision. They are also well known for their recreational value. Attempts to protect these ecosystems have not successfully stopped large-scale degradation. Significant efforts have been made by government and research organizations to ensure that coral reefs are monitored systematically to gain a deeper understanding of the causes, the effects and the extent of threats affecting coral reefs. However, further research is needed to fully understand the importance that sampling design has on coral reef characterization and assessment. This study examines the effect that sampling design has on the estimation of seascape metrics when coupling semi-autonomous underwater vehicles, structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and high resolution (0.4 cm) underwater imagery. For this purpose, we use FRAGSTATS v4 to estimate key seascape metrics that enable quantification of the area, density, edge, shape, contagion, interspersion and diversity of sessile organisms for a range of sampling scales (0.5 m × 0.5 m, 2 m × 2 m, 5 m × 5 m, 7 m × 7 m), quadrat densities (from 1–100 quadrats) and sampling strategies (nested vs. random) within a 1655 m2 case study area in Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (Mozambique). Results show that the benthic community is rather disaggregated within a rocky matrix; the embedded patches frequently have a small size and a regular shape; and the population is highly represented by soft corals. The genus Acropora is the more frequent and shows bigger colonies in the group of hard corals. Each of the seascape metrics has specific requirements of the sampling scale and quadrat density for robust estimation. Overall, the majority of the metrics were accurately identified by sampling scales equal to or coarser than 5 m × 5 m and quadrat densities equal to or larger than 30. The study indicates that special attention needs to be dedicated to the design of coral reef monitoring programmes, with decisions being based on the seascape metrics and statistics being determined. The results presented here are representative of the eastern South Africa coral reefs and are expected to be transferable to coral reefs with similar characteristics. The work presented here is limited to one study site and further research is required to confirm the findings.},

While some of the previous studies of Structure from Motion applied to underwater projects showed promise as an information rich and affordable survey method, the issue of accuracy remains. This study examined the efficacy of this new technology as a post-processing analytical tool on the early seventeenth-century shipwreck site, Warwick, from Bermuda. Using original digital images from the archaeological excavations, Structure from Motion was tested for suitability and accuracy, and the results compared against the Direct Survey Method. The outcome was an interdisciplinary effort that allowed for a better understanding of the process and the resulting limitations of Structure from Motion for underwater surveys and excavations.},

abstract = {Maritime cultural landscapes are collections of submerged archaeological sites, or combinations of terrestrial and submerged sites that reflect the relationship between humans and the water. These landscapes can range in size from a single beach to an entire coastline and can include areas of terrestrial sites now inundated as well as underwater sites that are now desiccated. However, what binds all of these sites together is the premise that each aspect of the landscape –cultural, political, environmental, technological, and physical – is interrelated and can not be understood without reference to the others. In this maritime cultural landscape approach, individual sites are treated as features within the larger landscape and the interpretation of single sites add to a larger analysis of a region or culture. This approach provides physical and theoretical links between terrestrial and underwater archaeology as well as prehistoric and historic archaeology; consequently, providing a framework for integrating such diverse topics as trade, resource procurement, habitation, industrial production, and warfare into a holistic study of the past. Landscape studies foster broader perspectives and approaches, extending the study of maritime cultures beyond the shoreline. Despite this potential, the archaeological study of maritime landscapes is a relatively untried approach with many questions regarding the methods and perspectives needed to effectively analyze these landscapes. The chapters in this volume, which include contributions from the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Australia, address many of the theoretical and methodological questions surrounding maritime cultural landscapes. The authors comprise established scholars as well as archaeologists at the beginning of their careers, providing a healthy balance of experience and innovation. The chapters also demonstrate parity between method and theory, where the varying interpretations of culture and space are given equal weight with the challenges of investigating both wet and dry sites across large areas.},

In particular, we compute the probability distribution over the sun position and visibility. The method relies on a com- bination of weak cues that can be extracted from different portions of the image: the sky, the vertical surfaces, and the ground. While no single cue can reliably estimate illumination by itself, each one can reinforce the others to yield a more robust estimate. This is combined with a data-driven prior computed over a dataset of 6 million Internet photos. We present quantitative results on a webcam dataset with annotated sun positions, as well as qualitative results on consumer-grade photographs downloaded from Internet. Based on the estimated illumination, we show how to realistically insert synthetic 3-D objects into the scene.},

abstract = {Structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithms greatly facilitate the production of detailed topographic models from photographs collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the survey quality achieved in published geomorphological studies is highly variable, and sufficient processing details are never provided to understand fully the causes of variability. To address this, we show how survey quality and consistency can be improved through a deeper consideration of the underlying photogrammetric methods. We demonstrate the sensitivity of digital elevation models (DEMs) to processing settings that have not been discussed in the geomorphological literature, yet are a critical part of survey georeferencing, and are responsible for balancing the contributions of tie and control points. We provide a Monte Carlo approach to enable geomorphologists to (1) carefully consider sources of survey error and hence increase the accuracy of SfM-based DEMs and (2) minimise the associated field effort by robust determination of suitable lower-density deployments of ground control. By identifying appropriate processing settings and highlighting photogrammetric issues such as over-parameterisation during camera self-calibration, processing artefacts are reduced and the spatial variability of error minimised. We demonstrate such DEM improvements with a commonly-used SfM-based software (PhotoScan), which we augment with semi-automated and automated identification of ground control points (GCPs) in images, and apply to two contrasting case studies ??? an erosion gully survey (Taroudant, Morocco) and an active landslide survey (Super-Sauze, France). In the gully survey, refined processing settings eliminated step-like artefacts of up to {\~{}}??50??mm in amplitude, and overall DEM variability with GCP selection improved from 37 to 16??mm. In the much more challenging landslide case study, our processing halved planimetric error to {\~{}}??0.1??m, effectively doubling the frequency at which changes in landslide velocity could be detected. In both case studies, the Monte Carlo approach provided a robust demonstration that field effort could by substantially reduced by only deploying approximately half the number of GCPs, with minimal effect on the survey quality. To reduce processing artefacts and promote confidence in SfM-based geomorphological surveys, published results should include processing details which include the image residuals for both tie points and GCPs, and ensure that these are considered appropriately within the workflow.},

abstract = {Multi-image photogrammetry is rapidly emerging as an important archaeological tool due in large part to the increasing level of automation in off the shelf software. The technique can offer significant reductions in the cost of archaeological survey and in the enhancement of survey results and is of particular value therefore to archaeologists working in contract-led context, which in many areas accounts for the majority of archaeological work (up to 80{\%} in Scotland for example). Recent advances in multi-image photogrammetric software have resulted in highly automated workflows and significantly reduced the burden of technical knowledge required to produce survey results of an acceptable standard. Although the majority of multi-image photogrammetry surveys are still undertaken in an academic context the technique is increasingly being used by a far wider proportion of heritage professionals, many of whom are not first and foremost specialists in photogrammetry. The adoption of such highly automated workflows presents certain risks with regard to accuracy and reliability of results as noted by Remondino etal. (2012, 52). However the enormous potential of the technique for rapid and accurate survey and for reduced costs cannot be ignored and the challenge we face is to ensure that the highly automated workflows adopted by archaeologists in contract-led contexts are robust and reliable and underpinned by guidance and knowledge exchange. This paper is not intended as a comprehensive technical review of the technical aspects of the technique or of its development but instead focusses on highlighting its potential as a practical everyday tool for archaeological practitioners to apply in two of the main types of contract-led archaeological work, rapid survey and community engagement. A non-technical overview of the technique is given followed by case studies illustrating how the technique has been applied successfully in a non-academic contract-led and community engagement context. These surveys have been undertaken with very limited budgets for both survey and post-processing of data and typically with very limited time frames. In each case study, use of multi-image photogrammetry has allowed for better, faster and more cost-effective results than would otherwise have been possible. Case studies include a survey of an Iron Age fort, a rapid survey of exposed segments of an intertidal wreck, both commissioned for heritage management purposes and a community survey of a 17th century gravestone undertaken by children under the age of 16. Finally the obstacles to wider adoption in the contract-led sector are discussed and it is argued that a concerted approach is required to create and disseminate simple and reliable workflows. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Acquisition and processing of point clouds, allowing the high dimensional accuracy that is an essential prerequisite for good documentation, are widely used today for cultural heritage surveys. In recent years, manual and direct surveys in archaeological survey campaigns have been replaced by digital image processing and laser-scanning. Multi-image photogrammetry has proven to be valuable for underwater archaeology. A topographical survey is always necessary to guarantee dimensional accuracy, and is necessary for geo-referencing all the finds in the same reference system. The need for low costs and rapid solutions, combined with the necessity of producing three-dimensional surveys with the same accuracy as classical terrestrial surveying, led the researchers to test and apply image-based techniques. Ca' Foscari and IUAV University of Venice are conducting research into integrated techniques for the accurate documentation of underwater surveys. Survey design, image acquisition, topographical measurements and data processing of two Roman shipwrecks in southern Sicily are presented in this paper. Photogrammetric and topographical surveys were organized using two distinct methods, due to the different characteristics of the cargoes of huge marble blocks, their depth and their distribution on the seabed. The results of the survey are two 3D polygonal-textured models of the sites, which can be easily used for various analyses and trial reconstructions, opening new possibilities for producing documentation for both specialists and the wider public. Furthermore, 3D models are the geometrical basis for making 2D orthophotos and cross-sections. The paper illustrates all the phases of the survey's design, acquisition and preparation, and the data processing to obtain final 2D and 3D representations.},

abstract = {With the ongoing loss of coral cover and the associated flattening of reef architecture, understanding the links between coral habitat and reef fishes is of critical importance. Here, we investigate whether considering coral traits and functional diversity provides new insights into the relationship between structural complexity and reef fish communities, and whether coral traits and community composition can predict structural complexity. Across 157 sites in Seychelles, Maldives, the Chagos Archipelago, and Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we find that structural complexity and reef zone are the strongest and most consistent predictors of reef fish abundance, biomass, species richness, and trophic structure. However, coral traits, diversity, and life histories provided additional predictive power for models of reef fish assemblages, and were key drivers of structural complexity. Our findings highlight that reef complexity relies on living corals—with different traits and life histories—continuing to build carbonate skeletons, and that these nuanced relationships between coral assemblages and habitat complexity can affect the structure of reef fish assemblages. Seascape-level estimates of structural complexity are rapid and cost effective with important implications for the structure and function of fish assemblages, and should be incorporated into monitoring programs.},

abstract = {Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66{\%}; RS: 76{\%}). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7–6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.},

However, traditional mapping techniques are usually restricted to down-looking approaches which cannot adequately replicate their 3D structure. We combined sideways-looking multibeam echosounder (MBES) data from an AUV, forward-looking MBES data from ROVs and ROV-acquired videos to examine walls from Rockall Bank and Whittard Canyon, Northeast Atlantic. High-resolution 3D point clouds were extracted from each sonar dataset and structure from motion photogrammetry (SfM) was applied to recreate 3D representations of video transects along the walls. With these reconstructions, it was possible to interact with extensive sections of video footage and precisely position individuals. Terrain variables were derived on scales comparable to those experienced by megabenthic individuals. These were used to show differences in environmental conditions between observed and background locations as well as explain spatial patterns in ecological characteristics. In addition, since the SfM 3D reconstructions retained colours, they were employed to separate and quantify live coral colonies versus dead framework. The combination of these new technologies allows us, for the first time, to map the physical 3D structure of previously inaccessible habitats and demonstrates the complexity and importance of vertical structures.},

abstract = {We propose an automatic method to infer high dynamic range illumination from a single, limited field-of-view, low dynamic range photograph of an indoor scene. In contrast to previous work that relies on specialized image capture, user input, and/or simple scene models, we train an end-to-end deep neural network that directly regresses a limited field-of-view photo to HDR illumination, without strong assumptions on scene geometry, material properties, or lighting. We show that this can be accomplished in a three step process: 1) we train a robust lighting classifier to automatically annotate the location of light sources in a large dataset of LDR environment maps, 2) we use these annotations to train a deep neural network that predicts the location of lights in a scene from a single limited field-of-view photo, and 3) we fine-tune this network using a small dataset of HDR environment maps to predict light intensities. This allows us to automatically recover high-quality HDR illumination estimates that significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, using our illumination estimates for applications like 3D object insertion, we can achieve results that are photo-realistic, which is validated via a perceptual user study.},

We propose a method where CNN-predicted dense depth maps are naturally fused together with depth measurements obtained from direct monocular SLAM. Our fusion scheme privileges depth prediction in image locations where monocular SLAM approaches tend to fail, e.g. along low-textured regions, and vice-versa. We demonstrate the use of depth prediction for estimating the absolute scale of the reconstruction, hence overcoming one of the major limitations of monocular SLAM. Finally, we propose a framework to efficiently fuse semantic labels, obtained from a single frame, with dense SLAM, yielding semantically coherent scene reconstruction from a single view. Evaluation results on two benchmark datasets show the robustness and accuracy of our approach.},

They allow the production of high quality 3D models by using unordered image collections that depict a scene or an object from different viewpoints. In this work, we question the quality of the data produced by a commercial SFM-DMVR software. An Ottoman monument located in the region of Xanthi, Greece has been selected as a case study. We attempted to quantify the quality of the SFM-DMVR data in relation to the data produced by a Time-of-Flight terrestrial 3D range scanner. We have implemented a number of comparisons between different parts of the monument in order to assess the mesh deviations and the reconstruction's accuracy. In order to further ensure the validity of our evaluation phase, we performed additional distance measurements between feature points on the monument's surface by using a total station and empirical measurements. The applicability of the SFM-DMVR method was questioned by creating a complete 3D digital replica of the monument. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Global coral reef related tourism is one of the most significant examples of nature-based tourism from a single ecosystem. Coral reefs attract foreign and domestic visitors and generate revenues, including foreign exchange earnings, in over 100 countries and territories. Understanding the full value of coral reefs to tourism, and the spatial distribution of these values, provides an important incentive for sustainable reef management. In the current work, global data from multiple sources, including social media and crowd-sourced datasets, were used to estimate and map two distinct components of reef value. The first component is local “reef-adjacent” value, an overarching term used to capture a range of indirect benefits from coral reefs, including provision of sandy beaches, sheltered water, food, and attractive views. The second component is “on-reef” value, directly associated with in-water activities such diving and snorkelling. Tourism values were estimated as a proportion of the total visits and spending by coastal tourists within 30 km of reefs (excluding urban areas). Reef-adjacent values were set as a fixed proportion of 10{\%} of this expenditure. On-reef values were based on the relative abundance of dive-shops and underwater photos in different countries and territories. Maps of value assigned to specific coral reef locations show considerable spatial variability across distances of just a few kilometres. Some 30{\%} of the world's reefs are of value in the tourism sector, with a total value estimated at nearly US{\$}36 billion, or over 9{\%} of all coastal tourism value in the world's coral reef countries.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for homing and docking an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to a subsea Docking station (DS) by combining acoustic and optical sensing. The AUV is assumed to be within acoustic ranging distance to the DS, whose location is otherwise unknown a priori. The homing and docking procedure comprises two stages. In the first stage, a Sum of Gaussian (SoG) filter is used to estimate the DS location while the AUV is guided along an observable trajectory. Once the DS position becomes known, the vehicle performs a homing maneuver to bring it within visual reach of the DS. In the second stage, a light beacon navigation system is used to estimate the DS pose with respect to the AUV. Visual information is used to update to a Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) filter providing an AUV-pose estimate with the accuracy required for the docking maneuver. The feasibility and performance of the method is evaluated through Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. The novelty and impact of the proposed approach lies in the complementarity of the two sensing modalities, which have not been yet demonstrated for AUV docking.},

abstract = {—Accurate and detailed 3-dimensional (3D) models of the underwater environment are becoming increasingly important in modern marine surveys, since they convey immense information that can be easily in-terpreted. Techniques such as bundle adjustment (BA) and structure from motion (SfM), which jointly esti-mate sparse 3D points of the scene and camera poses, have gained popularity in underwater mapping appli-cations. However, for large-area surveys these methods are computationally expensive and not intended for on-line application. This paper proposes an SfM pipeline based on solving the BA problem in an incremental and efficient way. Furthermore, the new system can provide not only the solution of the optimization (camera trajec-tory along time and the 3D points of the environment), but also the estimate of the uncertainty associated with the 3D reconstruction. This system is able to produce results in mission-time, i.e. while the robot is in the water or very shortly afterwards. Such quick availability is of great importance during survey operations as it allows data quality assessment in-situ, and eventual re-planning of missions in case of need.},

Loss of structural complexity is linked to ecosystem declines in biodiversity and resilience. We developed new methods using underwater stereo-imagery spanning 4 years (2010–2013) to reconstruct 3D models of coral reef areas and quantified both structural complexity at two spatial resolutions (2.5 and 25 cm) and benthic community composition to characterize changes after an unprecedented thermal anomaly on the west coast of Australia in 2011. Structural complexity increased at both resolutions in quadrats (4 m2) that bleached, but not those that did not bleach. Changes in complexity were driven by species-specific responses to warming, highlighting the importance of identifying small-scale dynamics to disentangle ecological responses to disturbance. We demonstrate an effective, repeatable method for quantifying the relationship among community composition, structural complexity and ocean warming, improving predictions of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental change.},

abstract = {In tropical reef ecosystems corals are the key habitat builders providing most ecosystem structure, which influences coral reef biodiversity and resilience. Remote sensing applications have progressed significantly and photogrammetry together with application of structure from motion software is emerging as a leading technique to create three-dimensional (3D) models of corals and reefs from which biophysical properties of structural complexity can be quantified. This enables the addressing of a range of important marine research questions, such as what the role of habitat complexity is in driving key ecological processes (i.e., foraging). Yet, it is essential to assess the accuracy and precision of photogrammetric measurements to support their application in mapping, monitoring and quantifying coral reef form and structure. This study evaluated the precision (by repeated modeling) and accuracy (by comparison with laser reference models) of geometry and structural complexity metrics derived from photogrammetric 3D models of marine benthic habitat at two ecologically relevant spatial extents; individual coral colonies of a range of common morphologies and patches of reef area of 100s of square metres. Surface rugosity measurements were generally precise across all morphologies and spatial extents with average differences in the geometry of replicate models of 1-6 mm for coral colonies and 25 mm for the reef area. Precision decreased with complexity of the coral morphology, with metrics for small massive corals being the most precise (1{\%} coefficient of variation (CV) in surface rugosity) and metrics for bottlebrush corals being the least precise (10{\%} CV in surface rugosity). There was no indication however that precision was related to complexity for the patch-scale modelling. The 3D geometry of coral models differed by only 1-3 mm from laser reference models. However, high spatial variation in these differences around the model led to a consistent underestimation of surface rugosity values for all morphs of between 8{\%} and 37{\%}. This study highlights the utility of several off-the-shelf photogrammetry tools for the measurement of structural complexity across a range of scales relevant to ecologist and managers. It also provides important information on the accuracy and precision of these systems which should allow for their targeted use by non-experts in computer vision within these contexts.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that urbanization usually leads to severe biotic homogenizing, i.e. the local extirpation of many native species and the expansion to regional scales of a small group of "urban-adaptors", some of them exotics. Margarita Island (Venezuela) is a tropical Caribbean island that has undergone an accelerated urban development in the last 40 years. Because the island also has a high bird diversity with several endemic and threatened species, we evaluated the effect of urban development on bird species richness, assemblage structure, seasonal changes and feeding guilds. We defined an urban gradient from areas with high vegetation cover (remnant woodlands) through areas with intermediate vegetation (traditional towns) to areas with next to no vegetation (recent suburbs). Each experimental unit was replicated 3 times and birds were surveyed during the dry and rainy seasons. Richness decreased as urbanization increased, being severely depleted in the recent suburbs. The bird assemblage consisted of native species, including six endemic sub-species, but only one exotic, Columba livia. There were no seasonal changes in assemblage structure. We identified the species most tolerant and most sensitive to urbanization. Omnivorous birds were common along the gradient and granivores were also tolerant to urban development. Specialized insectivores and frugivores were the most negatively affected groups. The considerable amount of native woodland and other vegetation present in the traditional towns we evaluated, and their proximity to natural protected areas, favors the persistence of native bird species in these urban areas on Margarita Island.},

To reach this new definition, we review MLS surfaces in terms of local kernel regression, opening the doors to a vast and well established literature from which we utilize robust kernel regression. Our novel representation can handle sparse sampling, generates a continuous surface better preserving fine details, and can naturally handle any kind of sharp features with controllable sharpness.

These tasks pose a challenge to computer vision since decades. Today the most common techniques for 3D sensing are CCD- or CMOS-camera, laser scanner or 3D time-of-flight camera based. Even though evolution has shown predominance for passive stereo vision systems, three additional problems are remaining for 3D perception compared with the two mentioned active vision systems above. First, the computation needs a great deal of performance, since the correlation of two images from a different point of view has to be found. Second, distances to structureless surfaces cannot be measured, if the perspective projection of the object is larger than the camera's field of view. This problem is often called aperture problem. Finally, a passive visual sensor has to cope with shadowing effects and changes in illumination over time.},

The central advantages of our approach compared to existing planar MLS include significantly improved stability of the projection under low sampling rates and in the presence of high curvature. The method can approximate or interpolate the input point set and naturally handles planar point clouds. In addition, our approach provides a reliable estimate of the mean curvature of the surface at no additional cost and allows for the robust handling of sharp features and boundaries. It processes a simple point set as input, but can also take significant advantage of surface normals to improve robustness, quality and performance. We also present an novel normal estimation procedure which exploits the properties of the spherical fit for both direction estimation and orientation propagation. Very efficient computational procedures enable us to compute the algebraic sphere fitting with up to 40 million points per second on latest generation GPUs.},

Thus, image segmentation is a critical step in the classification pipeline. In general, the segmentation algorithm that leads to the best overall classification accuracy does not necessarily imply best classification accuracy with respect to each of the individual classes. In addition, in real time applications, changes in the environment or in the image acquisition devices require fast adjustments in the classification pipeline. Customizing segmentation algorithms for each situation may demand considerable effort. Motivated by these issues, we address the problem of using multiple segmentation algorithms and letting the classifier decide how to make best use of them.

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for estimating the relative location and orientation between two or more underwater vehicles operating in tight formation. One of the vehicles is equipped with a camera of wide field of view. The other vehicle(s) are equipped with active light markers to enable the use of computer vision for pose estimation. The pose estimation addresses two scenarios, which are both important from the operational point of view. The first pertains to the availability of an acoustic communication channel which allows for exchanging attitude data and acoustic ranging, and use it in the pose estimation procedure. The second corresponds to the exclusive use of a set of 4 or more optical beacons with no acoustic information exchange, which is a capability that has not been yet proposed nor demonstrated in underwater vehicles. The contributions can be summarize as (1) a novel method of estimating the pose of an autonomous underwater vehicle using light beacons and other sensors when available, (2) an automated marker configuration analysis approach. Performance of the pose estimation approach is evaluated using synthetic and real data.},

We use techniques from robust statistics to guide the creation of the neighborhoods used by the moving least squares (MLS) computation. This leads to a conceptually simple approach that provides a unified framework for not only dealing with noise, but also for enabling the modeling of surfaces with sharp features.Our technique is based on a new robust statistics method for outlier detection: the forward-search paradigm. Using this powerful technique, we locally classify regions of a point-set to multiple outlier-free smooth regions. This classification allows us to project points on a locally smooth region rather than a surface that is smooth everywhere, thus defining a piecewise smooth surface and increasing the numerical stability of the projection operator. Furthermore, by treating the points across the discontinuities as outliers, we are able to define sharp features. One of the nice features of our approach is that it automatically disregards outliers during the surface-fitting phase.},

abstract = {Sharp features in manufactured and designed objects require particular attention when reconstructing surfaces from unorganized scan point sets using moving least squares (MLS) fitting. It is an inherent property of MLS fitting that sharp features are smoothed out. Instead of searching for appropriate new fitting functions our approach computes a modified local point neighborhood so that a standard MLS fitting can be applied enhanced by sharp features reconstruction. We present a two-stage algorithm. In a pre-processing step sharp feature points are marked first. This algorithm is robust to noise since it is based on Gauss map clustering. In the main phase, the selected feature points are used to locally approximate the feature curve and to segment and enhance the local point neighborhood. The MLS projection thus leads to a piecewise smooth surface preserving all sharp features. The method is simple to implement and able to preserve line-type features as well as corner-type features during reconstruction. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Survey protocols for monitoring the composition and status of coral reef benthic communities vary in the level of detail acquired, but fundamentally follow one of two approaches: 1) a diver identifies organisms in the field, 2) an analyst identifies organisms from underwater imagery (photos or video). Both methods are highly labor intensive and require a trained biologist/geologist. A method for automated classification of reef benthos would improve coral reef monitoring by reducing the cost of data analysis. Spectral classification of standard (three-band) color underwater imagery does not work well for distinguishing major bottom types. Recent publications of hyperspectral reflectance of corals, algae, and sediment, on the other hand, suggest that careful choice of narrow (-10 nm) spectral bands might improve classification accuracy relative to the three wide bands available on commercial cameras. We built an underwater multispectral camera to test whether narrow spectral bands were actually superior to standard RGB cameras for automated classification of underwater images. A filter wheel was used to acquire imagery in six 10 nm spectral bands, which were chosen from suggestions in the literature. Results indicate that the algorithms suggested in the literature require very careful compensation for variable illumination and water column attenuation for even marginal success in classifying underwater imagery. On the other hand, a new algorithm, based on the normalized difference ratio of images at 568 nm and 546 nm can reliably segment photosynthetic organisms (corals and algae) from non-photosynthetic background. Moreover, when this new algorithm is combined with very simple texture segmentation, the general cover classes of coral and algae can be discriminated from the image background with accuracies on the order of 80{\%}. These results suggest that a combination of high spectral resolution and texture-based image segmentation may be an optimal methodology for aut- omated classification of underwater coral reef imagery.},

abstract = {Spaceborne remote sensing has resolved critical issues for mapping coral reef structure that human- and ship-based surveys could not have overcome, namely the spatial continuity regardless of the water depth. With the emergence of very high spatial resolution sensors, the spatial capabilities of satellites have outperformed those of aircraft, providing spectral information at the dominant benthos scale but over large areas. With the launch of the WorldView-2 (WV2) sensor, coral reefs can now be surveyed using eight bands at {\~{}}2 m spatial resolution, somewhat bridging the gap with high spatial resolution, hyperspectral airborne sensors. The WV2 spectral capabilities were utilized for modeling an in situ gradient of Live Coral Cover (LCC). Georeferenced underwater photoquadrats were collected to discern among ten benthic classes, ranging from coralligeneous sand to live Synarea rus bommie or Acropora pulchra thicket, and to compute the LCC. From the benthic images of the five WV2 visible bands (purple, blue, green, yellow, red), 20 pairwise combinations were tested in the form of a Normalized Difference Ratio (NDR). Four spectral combinations were revealed with high correlations ({\textgreater}0.8) with in situ ground-truthing. Associating the common green band with the innovative purple band, the NDR green-purple showed a strong linear relationship with the LCC (R²=0.96, p{\textless}0.001). The successful combination was mapped over the entire scene, reliably highlighting live corals while being less sensitive to dead corals and sediment. Discussed to be a proxy for the amount of zooxanthellate- borne pigments such as perdinin, the green-purple NDR holds great promise to map, detect and predict change in coral reefs at the dominant benthos scale regionally, aiding their management and conservation.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of digital cameras and automatic acquisition systems, scientists can acquire vast numbers of images for quantitative analysis. However, much image analysis is conducted manually, which is both time consuming and prone to error. As a result, valuable scientific data from many domains sit dormant in image libraries awaiting annotation. This work addresses one such domain: coral reef coverage estimation. In this setting, the goal, as defined by coral reef ecologists, is to determine the percentage of the reef surface covered by rock, sand, algae, and corals; it is often desirable to resolve these taxa at the genus level or below. This is challenging since the data exhibit significant within class variation, the borders between classes are complex, and the viewpoints and image quality vary. We introduce Moorea Labeled Corals, a large multi-year dataset with 400,000 expert annotations, to the computer vision community, and argue that this type of ecological data provides an excellent opportunity for performance benchmarking. We also propose a novel algorithm using texture and color descriptors over multiple scales that outperforms commonly used techniques from the texture classification literature. We show that the proposed algorithm accurately estimates coral coverage across locations and years, thereby taking a significant step towards reliable automated coral reef image annotation.},

abstract = {Monitoring fish and underwater habitats, particularly in and around marine protected areas (MPAs) requires non-destructive observation methods. This is generally achieved by divers conducting underwater visual censuses (UVC), but video-based techniques are now being used more often to observe underwater macrofauna and habitats. A comparison of these two techniques is relevant with the development of high-definition (HD) video, which constitutes a substantial improvement over previously available video resolutions at limited extra cost. We conducted a paired observation experiment involving both HD video and UVC in an MPA located in the New Caledonian lagoon, which is a highly diversified coral reef ecosystem. We compared three techniques for counting fish along 50 m × 4 m delineated strip transects: UVC and two video techniques in which the diver used either a straight trajectory (I-type transect) or a browsing one (S-type transect). The results showed that the proportion of fish that were not identified up to the species level did not exceed 3.3{\%} in video observations versus 1.7{\%} in UVC. The abundance and species richness were larger in UVC than in videos, and S-type transects detected more individuals and species than I-type transects. The average abundance and species richness observed by UVC were 1094 individuals and 69.7 species per transect respectively. In comparison with UVC, I-type and S-type video transects detected on average 56{\%} and 61{\%} of the abundance and 85{\%} and 77{\%} of the species richness seen by UVC respectively. Our results showed that, in comparison to UVC data recorded in situ, the post field analysis of HD video images provided representative observations of fish abundance and species diversity, although fewer species and individuals were detected. The advantages and shortcomings of each observation technique for monitoring fish assemblages, particularly in an MPA are discussed. HD video appears to be a cost-effective technique in terms of the human resources and time needed for field implementation. Overall, this study suggests that HD video-based techniques constitute an interesting complement to UVC, or an alternative when these cannot be implemented.},

abstract = {The assessment of anthropogenic impacts and ecological status of coastal waters is an important task to accomplish under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EEC). Macroalgae are one of the biological quality elements that must be considered, but their assessment has been generally limited to intertidal areas due to the difficulties and costs associated with working in subtidal areas. In this work, the suitability of using landscape mosaicing techniques is analyzed for the application of the "Quality of Rocky Bottoms" index (CFR by its Spanish acronym) in subtidal areas. For this purpose, the sensitivity and accuracy of both the indicators that compose the CFR index (characteristic macroalgae coverage, fraction of opportunistics and characteristic macroalgae richness) and the index itself were tested against different sampling surfaces and validated through direct applications of the CFR carried out in situ by scuba divers. The study was carried out at three sites, located on the coast of Cantabria (N. Spain), covering a variety of environmental conditions (depth ranges and anthropogenic pressures). Underwater video transects of 5-20m length were recorded by scuba divers and processed with specialized software to build continuous image mosaics of the assessment sites. Each mosaic was inserted into a Geographical Information System where all distinguishable macroalgal species were identified and their coverages were estimated. Replicated subsamples of different areas (0.25m2, 0.5m2, 1m2 and 2.5m2) were tested from each mosaic for the estimation of both the single indicators and the CFR index itself. Main results showed that larger subsample areas produced higher and more accurate CFR values, mainly related to higher srichness values and to smaller variability within the replicates. Accordingly, the minimum sample size required to carry out this type of studies was estimated to be of 2.5m2, showing no significant differences with the total mosaics. At this spatial scale, the assessments of the CFR index using mosaics showed a significant correlation and an excellent agreement with the results obtained in situ. In summary, underwater video mosaicing techniques proved to be a useful tool for the application of the CFR index and could also be of great interest for the study of subtidal environments by allowing visualization of extensive seafloor areas.},

abstract = {This paper describes a 3-D reconstruction method which allows accurate measurements of volume, surface area and other morphometric measurements of three-dimensional biological objects, without removing them from the sea. It represents a novel approach based on multiple views (eight resulted to be sufficient) from underwater video images and a new image processing procedure (MOD3D), whose application has met the basic requirements (i.e. to work on images recorded in turbid waters, with nonuniform lighting, to investigate large areas and in reasonable time, etc.) imposed when operating in the marine environment with simple, easy-to-use and nonprofessional equipment. It is a noninvasive, nondestructive and in the field fast method, thus suitable for sampling also at relevant depth, whose applicability has specifically been set up for a range of growth forms from massive to submassive and irregularly shaped. The accuracy of the method was assessed using models with three levels of 3-D complexity: simple, moderate and complex morphology. A high accuracy of volume measurements made through MOD3D image analysis software was achieved when compared with the laboratory water displacement method, which represents the most accurate method for volume measurement, with an overall mean percent error of about 1.7{\%} (S.D. 2.2{\%}). For all three levels of morphologic complexity, no significant differences (p{\textgreater}0.05) were found. Volume measurements obtained in field based on geometric approximation resulted rough, with significant differences from the MOD3D values (p{\textless}0.05). The geometric approximation was lower than MOD3D for simple and moderate morphology, and variable for complex morphology. For all three models, MOD3D values for surface area computation were consistently lower (mean error 13{\%}) than the foil-wrapping values (p{\textless}0.05), due to overlap error when foil wrapping. Two applications were made with the bryozoan Pentapora fascialis and the coral Cladocora caespitosa to quantify carbonate standing stock and biomass of these two carbonate framework builders, whose importance has been recently recognised among the temperate sublittoral benthic species. Time required for the 3-D reconstruction method (about 3 h) makes it suitable for routine application particularly for relatively large area investigations, with irregularly shaped objects on rough substrate and several biological objects within the area. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Structure from Motion (SfM) technology proved to be best suited to maritime archaeology as it generates 3D models from 2D images. The researchers input video images into SfM software to render accurate 3D models of shipwrecks, thus creating an innovative, affordable, and accurate option for maritime archaeologists. Two case studies of sunken schooners resting in the Great Lakes were detailed. The results revealed that measurements for the larger portions of the vessels showed a lower margin of error (percentage wise) than the smaller components. Lack of video coverage for all angles of the vessels was a factor. Nevertheless, this study shows that with the proper amount of video footage, this method is a promising means of rendering an accurate 3D model of underwater ships through the SfM software.

abstract = {Optical sensing in an underwater environment can be challenging due to the complex attenuation and scattering properties of the water. These cause colour changes which can be variant on factors such as the constituents within the water, sunlight/weather changes and distance to the object of interest. It is desirable to correct for the water's influence so as to recover a true reflectance/colour of the imaged scene. This is necessary in the application of benthic mapping where producing inter- and intra-site colour consistent images is important for classification and characterisation of these habitats. We present a new method which involves sensing the incoming irradiance to the scene from two locations above and below the water and colour correcting the image. The light is sensed in the hyperspectral domain, leading to other uses in the examination of the water column. In this paper we present colour correction in the trichromatic domain but this is equally applicable in the hyperspectral domain.},

Moreover, a color correction method is adopted to enhance the color contrast for underwater image. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively enhance the underwater image and reduce the execution time.

abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision and image analysis have led to the development of a novel, fully automated photogrammetric method to generate dense 3d point cloud data. This approach, termed Structure-from-Motion or SfM, requires only limited ground-control and is ideally suited to imagery obtained from low-cost, non-metric cameras acquired either at close-range or using aerial platforms. Terrain models generated using SfM have begun to emerge recently and with a growing spectrum of software now available, there is an urgent need to provide a robust quality assessment of the data products generated using standard field and computational workflows.To address this demand, we present a detailed error analysis of sub-meter resolution terrain models of two contiguous reaches (1.6 and 1.7. km long) of the braided Ahuriri River, New Zealand, generated using SfM. A six stage methodology is described, involving: i) hand-held image acquisition from an aerial platform, ii) 3d point cloud extraction modeling using Agisoft PhotoScan, iii) georeferencing on a redundant network of GPS-surveyed ground-control points, iv) point cloud filtering to reduce computational demand as well as reduce vegetation noise, v) optical bathymetric modeling of inundated areas; and vi) data fusion and surface modeling to generate sub-meter raster terrain models. Bootstrapped geo-registration as well as extensive distributed GPS and sonar-based bathymetric check-data were used to quantify the quality of the models generated after each processing step.The results obtained provide the first quantified analysis of SfM applied to model the complex terrain of a braided river. Results indicate that geo-registration errors of 0.04. m (planar) and 0.10. m (elevation) and vertical surface errors of 0.10. m in non-vegetation areas can be achieved from a dataset of photographs taken at 600. m and 800. m above the ground level. These encouraging results suggest that this low-cost, logistically simple method can deliver high quality terrain datasets competitive with those obtained with significantly more expensive laser scanning, and suitable for geomorphic change detection and hydrodynamic modeling. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Robust and performing navigation systems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play a discriminant role towards the success of complex underwater missions involving one or more AUVs. The quality of the filtering algorithm for the estimation of the AUV navigation state strongly affects the performance of the overall system. In this paper, the authors present a comparison between the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach, classically used in the field of underwater robotics and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The comparison results to be significant as the two strategies of filtering are based on the same process and sensors models. The UKF-based approach, here adapted to the AUV case, demonstrates to be a good trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational load. UKF has not yet been extensively used in practical underwater applications, even if it turns out to be quite promising. The proposed results rely on the data acquired during a sea mission performed by one of the two Typhoon class vehicles involved in the NATO CommsNet13 experiment (held in September 2013). As ground truth for performance evaluation and comparison, performed offline, position measurements obtained through Ultra-Short BaseLine (USBL) fixes are used. The result analysis leads to identify both the strategies as effective for the purpose of being included in the control loop of an AUV. The UKF approach demonstrates higher performance encouraging its implementation as a more suitable navigation algorithm even if, up to now, it is still not used much in this field.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

Here, we demonstrate the application of structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry to generate high-resolution, three-dimensional bathymetric models of a fringing reef from existing underwater video collected to characterize the seafloor. SfM techniques are capable of achieving spatial resolution that can be orders of magnitude greater than large-scale lidar and sonar mapping of coral reef ecosystems. The resulting data provide finer-scale measurements of bathymetry and rugosity that are more applicable to ecological studies of coral reefs than provided by the more expensive and time-consuming geophysical methods. Utilizing SfM techniques for characterizing the benthic habitat proved to be more effective and quantitatively powerful than conventional methods and thus might portend the end of the ‘chain-and-tape' method for measuring benthic complexity.},

abstract = {With ever increasing global demand and depleting resources for fossil fuels, oil and gas industry is now positively looking for advanced robotic solutions to increase their productivity and safety. With time easy resources of the fossil fuels are shrinking and newly searched reservoirs, to feed supply demands of global consumption, are mostly located in extreme environmental conditions such as hot deserts, deep water and arctic zone etc. Production of the fossil fuels, in such inhospitable environmental conditions, poses difficult challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE). Tragic incidents like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills are examples of such challenges. Therefore, oil and gas industry has lot to learn from successful implementation of robotics and automation for dull, dirty and dangerous (3D) tasks of manufacturing industry. Most of the robotics technologies, currently used in the oil and gas industry, are mainly focused on inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) of plant facilities with higher frequency and accuracy. Fundamental idea, involved in the automatization of these processes, is based on the principle of teleoperation with skilled operator. Automation of 3D tasks not only improves HSE standards but also lead to much needed economic efficiency by reducing production cycle, floor space and number of staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the risks involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots, first without achieving very high reliability, is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots, where actions are performed by robots but cognitive decisions are still taken by skilled operator, is an excellent choice for this industry as a near future solution. In the onshore oil and gas industry robotic solutions are used both in upstream and downstream processes, such as site survey, drilling, production and transportation, mainly focused in the form of in-pipe inspection robots (IPIRs), tank inspection robots (TIRs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) etc. This paper presents the state of art robotic solutions currently used in onshore oil and gas facilities.},

abstract = {Visual 3D reconstruction techniques provide rich ecological and habitat structural infor- mation from underwater imagery. However, an unaided swimmer or diver struggles to navigate precisely over larger extents with consistent image overlap needed for visual reconstruction. While underwater robots have demonstrated systematic coverage of areas much larger than the footprint of a single image, access to suitable robotic systems is limited and requires specialized operators. Furthermore, robots are poor at navigating hydrodynamic habitats such as shallow coral reefs. We present a simple approach that constrains the motion of a swimmer using a line unwinding from a fixed central drum. The resulting motion is the involute of a circle, a spiral- like path with constant spacing be- tween revolutions. We test this survey method at a broad range of habitats and hydrody- namic conditions encircling Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The approach generates fast, structured, repeatable, and large- extent surveys ({\~{}}110 m2 in 15 min) that can be performed with two people and are superior to the commonly used “mow the lawn” method. The amount of image overlap is a design parameter, allowing for surveys that can then be reliably used in an automated processing pipeline to generate 3D recon- structions, orthographically projected mosaics, and structural complexity indices. The in- dividual images or full mosaics can also be labeled for benthic diversity and cover estimates. The survey method we present can serve as a standard approach to repeatedly collecting underwater imagery for high- resolution 2D mosaics and 3D reconstructions covering spatial extents much larger than a single image footprint without requiring sophisticated robotic systems or lengthy deployment of visual guides. As such, it opens up cost- effective novel observations to inform studies relating habitat structure to ecological processes and biodiversity at scales and spatial resolutions not readily available previously},

We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on 4 texture and 5 object databases.

In Underwater images the numbers of distortion occurred are blurring of image, illumination of light and rotation of angle, noise etc. Features are normally extracted by the method called SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform for underwater images). It is used for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be invariant to image scale and rotation. It is used in image mosaic, recognition, retrieval and etc. where PCA-SIFT (Principal Component Analysis-Scale Invariant Feature Transform) is also used for dimension reduction and feature detection for underwater images. In this paper we propose a method by combining KPCA and SIFT together called KPCA-SIFT feature detection for underwater images. It is well suited for blur, illumination change and rotation of the input image. When apply PCA to the normalized gradient patch it reduces the dimension of the feature extracted. The parameters used for evaluation are Precision Vs Recall curve and the parameter like elapsed time, sigma value and threshold value. PNN classification is used for underwater images. The proposed method gives desirable results with respect to parameters like Roc curve, Precision Vs Recall, Elapsed time and sigma value. It is more robust and distinctive image deformation and more compact. with increased accuracy and faster matching than the PCA SIFT and SIFT algorithms.},

abstract = {Correlation is widely used as an effective similarity measure in matching tasks. However, traditional correlation based matching methods are limited to the short baseline case. In this paper we propose a new correlation based method for matching two images with large camera motion. Our method is based on the rotation and scale invariant normalized cross-correlation. Both the size and the orientation of the correlation windows are determined according to the characteristic scale and the dominant direction of the interest points. Experimental results on real images demonstrate that the new method is effective for matching image pairs with significant rotation and scale changes as well as other common imaging conditions},

abstract = {This paper studies the one-shot and zero-shot learning problems, where each object category has only one training example or has no training example at all. We approach this problem by transferring knowledge from known categories (a.k.a source categories) to new categories (a.k.a target categories) via object attributes. Object attributes are high level descriptions of object categories, such as color, texture, shape, etc. Since they represent common properties across different categories, they can be used to transfer knowledge from source categories to target categories effectively. Based on this insight, we propose an attribute-based transfer learning framework in this paper. We first build a generative attribute model to learn the probabilistic distributions of image features for each attribute, which we consider as attribute priors. These attribute priors can be used to (1) classify unseen images of target categories (zero-shot learning), or (2) facilitate learning classifiers for target categories when there is only one training examples per target category (one-shot learning). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches using the Animal with Attributes data set and show state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and one-shot learning tests. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Finding high-value locations for in situ data collection is of substantial importance in ocean science, where diverse bio-physical processes interact to create dynamically evolving phenomena. These cover a variable spatial extent, and are sparse and difficult to predict. Autonomous robotic platforms can sustain themselves in harsh conditions with persistent presence, but require deployment at the correct place and time. To that end, we consider the use of remote sensing data for building compact models that can improve skill in predicting sub-mesoscale features and inform onboard sampling. The model enables prediction of regional patterns based on sparse in situ data, a capability that is essential in regions where use of satellite remote sensing in real time is often limited by cloud cover. Our model is based on classification of sea-surface temperature (SST) images, but the technique is general across any remotely sensed parameter. Images having similar magnitude and spatial patterns are grouped into a compact set of conditional means representing the dominant states. The classification is unsupervised and uses a combination of dictionary learning and hierarchical clustering. The method is demonstrated using SST images from Monterey Bay, California. The consistency of the classification result is verified and compared with oceanographic forcing using historical wind measurements. The established model is then shown to work in a real application using measurements from an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), together with forecast and sampling strategies. Finally an analysis of the model prediction error is presented and compared across different paths and survey duration.},

abstract = {Seafloor massive sulphide (SMS) deposits are hosts to a wide range of economic minerals, and may become an important resource in the future. The exploitation of these resources is associated with considerable expenses, and a return on investment may depend on the availability of multiple deposits. Therefore, efficient exploration methodologies for base metal deposits are important for future deep sea mining endeavours. Underwater hyperspectral imaging (UHI) has been demonstrated to be able to differentiate between different types of materials on the seafloor. The identification of possible end-members from field data requires prior information in the form of representative signatures for distinct materials. This work presents hyperspectral imaging applied to a selection of materials from the Loki's Castle active hydrothermal vent site in a laboratory setting. A methodology for compensating for systematic effects and producing the reflectance spectra is detailed, and applied to recover the spectral signatures from the samples. The materials investigated were found to be distinguishable using unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods, and may be used as a reference for future field application.},

Control algorithm of vertical-thrusters was designed. Based on this, restart simulation model was established. Two kinds of restart strategy of the AUV that can park on the seabed were proposed, which are taking off freely with positive buoyancy, taking off under the control of vertical thrusters. On this basis, the impact of position of water entered into the AUV on restart parameters was studied. Finally, the influences of vertical thrusters on restart strategy were analyzed through comparing different restart strategies. Results show that variable buoyancy system should be amounted at -0.6{\~{}}0.6 m and vertical thrusters have a positive impact on restart strategy.

abstract = {Large, agglutinating protozoans belonging to the Foraminiferida (suborder Astrorhizina) and the Xenophyophorea are conspicuous, often dominant faunal elements in the deep sea. A review of known and suspected interactions between these forms and metazoans reveals a potentially significant role for the protozoans in structuring deep-sea metazoan assemblages. Direct interactions include provision to metazoans of (a) hard or stable substratum, (b) refuge from predators or physical disturbance, and (c) access to enhanced dietary resources. In some instances, rhizopod tests may provide a nursery function. Xenophyophore modification of flow regimes, particle flux, bottom skin friction and sediment characteristics appear likely and are believed to account for altered composition and abundance of meiofauna and macrofauna in the vicinity of rhizopod tests. Some analogous interactions are observed between metazoans and biogenic sediment structures in shallow water. However, metazoan-rhizopod associations are hypothesized to be more highly developed and complex in the deep sea than are comparable shallow-water associations, due to rhizopod abilities to enhance scarce food resources and to low rates of disturbance in much of the deep sea. Agglutinating rhizopods appear to be a significant source of heterogeneity on the deep-sea floor and large tests often represent "hotspots" of metazoan activity. As such, they are hypothesized to have contributed to the origin and maintenance of metazoan diversity in the deep sea by providing distinct microenvironments in which species can specialize. {\textcopyright} 1991 by the American Society of Zoologists.},

abstract = {Continental shelf sediments are globally important for biogeochemical activity. Quantification of shelf-scale stocks and fluxes of carbon and nutrients requires the extrapolation of observations made at limited points in space and time. The procedure for selecting exemplar sites to form the basis of this up-scaling is discussed in relation to a UK-funded research programme investigating biogeochemistry in shelf seas. A three-step selection process is proposed in which (1) a target area representative of UK shelf sediment heterogeneity is selected, (2) the target area is assessed for spatial heterogeneity in sediment and habitat type, bed and water column structure and hydrodynamic forcing, and (3) study sites are selected within this target area encompassing the range of spatial heterogeneity required to address key scientific questions regarding shelf scale biogeochemistry, and minimise confounding variables. This led to the selection of four sites within the Celtic Sea that are significantly different in terms of their sediment, bed structure, and macrofaunal, meiofaunal and microbial community structures and diversity, but have minimal variations in water depth, tidal and wave magnitudes and directions, temperature and salinity. They form the basis of a research cruise programme of observation, sampling and experimentation encompassing the spring bloom cycle. Typical variation in key biogeochemical, sediment, biological and hydrodynamic parameters over a pre to post bloom period are presented, with a discussion of anthropogenic influences in the region. This methodology ensures the best likelihood of site-specific work being useful for up-scaling activities, increasing our understanding of benthic biogeochemistry at the UK-shelf scale.},

abstract = {The development of precise and robust navigation strategies for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is fundamental to reach the high level of performance required by complex underwater tasks, often including more than one AUV. One of the main factors affecting the accuracy of AUVs navigation systems is the algorithm used to estimate the vehicle motion, usually based on kinematic vehicle models and linear estimators. A precise and reliable navigation system is indeed fundamental to AUVs: the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is not available underwater, thus making it very hard to know the position of the vehicle in real-time. In this paper, the authors present an innovative navigation strategy specifically designed for AUVs, based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The new algorithm proves to be effective if applied to this class of vehicles and allows us to achieve a satisfying accuracy improvement compared to standard navigation algorithms. The proposed strategy has been experimentally validated using the navigation data acquired in suitable sea tests performed in Biograd Na Moru (Croatia) in the framework of the FP7 European ARROWS project tests performed during the Breaking the Surface 2014 (BtS 2014) workshop. The vehicles involved are the two Typhoon AUVs, developed and built by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence within the THESAURUS Tuscany Region project for exploration and surveillance of underwater archaeological sites. The experiment, described in the paper, was performed to preliminary test the cooperative navigation between these AUVs. The new algorithm has been initially tested offline, and the validation of the proposed strategy provided accurate results in estimating the vehicle dynamic behaviour.},

abstract = {Seagrass communities are considered one of the most productive and complex marine ecosystems. Seagrasses belong to a small group of 66 species that can form extensive meadows in all coastal areas of our planet. Posidonia oceanica beds are the most characteristic ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea, and should be constantly monitored, preserved and maintained, as specified by EU Habitats Directive for priority habitats. Underwater 3D imaging by means of still or video cameras can allow a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of these meadows, but also of the seafloor morphology and integrity. Video-photographic devices and open source software for acquiring and managing 3D optical data rapidly became more and more effective and economically viable, making underwater 3D mapping an easier task to carry out. 3D reconstruction of the underwater scene can be obtained with photogrammetric techniques that require just one or more digital cameras, also in stereo configuration. In this work we present the preliminary results of a pilot 3D mapping project applied to the P. oceanica meadow in the Marine Protected Area of Capo Rizzuto (KR, Calabria Region – Italy).},

abstract = {Multi-facet diversity indices have been increasingly widely used in conservation ecology but congruence analyses both on horizontal and vertical axes have not yet been explored. We investigated the vertical and horizontal distributions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) in a three-dimensional structured ecosystem. We focused on the Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages which form complex structures both vertically and horizontally, and are considered as the most diverse and threatened communities of the Mediterranean Sea. Although comparable to tropical reef assemblages in terms of richness, biomass and production, coralligenous assemblages are less known and more rarely studied, in particular because of their location in deep waters. Our study covers the entire range of distribution of coralligenous habitats along the French Mediterranean coasts, representing the most complete database so far developed for this important ecosystem. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of spatial diversity patterns of marine biodiversity on both horizontal and vertical scales. Our study revealed that taxonomic diversity differed from functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns at the station level, the latter two being strongly structured by depth, with shallower stations generally richer than deeper ones. Considering all stations, phylogenetic diversity was less congruent to taxonomic diversity (Pearson's correlation of r = 0.48) but more congruent to functional diversity (r = 0.69) than randomly expected. Similar congruence patterns were revealed for stations deeper than 50 m (r = 0.44 and r = 0.84, respectively) but no significantly different congruence level than randomly expected was revealed among diversity facets for more shallow stations. Mean functional $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity were lower than phylogenetic diversity and even lower than taxonomic $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity for both vertical and horizontal scales. Low FD and PD values at both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity indicated functional and phylogenetic clustering. Community dissimilarities ($\beta$-diversity) increased over depth especially in central and eastern part of the French Mediterranean littoral and in northern Corsica, indicating coralligenous vertical structure within these regions. Overall horizontal $\beta$-diversity was higher within the 50-70 m depth belts. We conclude that taxonomic diversity alone is inadequate as a basis for setting conservation goals for this ecosystem and additional information, at least on phylogenetic diversity, is needed to preserve the ecosystem functioning and coralligenous evolutionary history. Our results highlight the necessity of considering different depth belts as a basis for regional scale conservation efforts. Current conservation approaches, such as the existing marine protected areas, are insufficient in preserving coralligenous habitats. The use of multi-facet indices should be considered, focusing on preserving local diversity patterns and compositional dissimilarities, both vertically and horizontally.},

Digital image processing and laser scanner have changed the archaeological survey campaign, from manual and direct survey to a digital one and, actually, multi-image photogrammetry is a good solution for the underwater archaeology. This technical documentation cannot operate alone, but it has to be supported by a topographical survey to georeference all the finds in the same reference system. In the last years the Ca' Foscari and IUAV University of Venice are conducting a research on integrated survey techniques to support underwater metric documentation. The paper will explain all the phases regarding the survey's design, images acquisition, topographic measure and the data processing of two Roman shipwrecks in south Sicily. The cargos of the shipwrecks are composed by huge marble blocks, but they are different for morphological characteristic of the sites, for the depth and for their distribution on the seabed. Photogrammetrical and topographical surveys were organized in two distinct methods, especially for the second one, due to the depth that have allowed an experimentation of GPS RTK's measurements on one shipwreck. Moreover, this kind of three-dimensional documentation is useful for educational and dissemination aspect, for the ease of understanding by wide public.},

abstract = {Underwater photogrammetry provides an efficient means for documentation of environments which are complex and have limited accessibility. Yet the establishment of reference control networks in such settings is oftentimes difficult. In this regard, use of the coplanarity condition, which requires neither knowledge of object space coordinates nor setting a reference control network, seems to be an attractive solution. However, the coplanarity relation does not hold in such environments because of the refraction effect, and methods that have been proposed thus far for geometrical modeling of its effect require knowledge of object-space quantities. Thus, this paper proposes a geometrically-driven approach which fulfills the coplanarity condition and thereby requires no knowledge of object space data. Such an approach may prove useful not only for object space reconstruction but also as a preparatory step for application of bundle block adjustment and for outlier detection. All are key features in photogrammetric practices. Results show that no unique setup is needed for estimating the relative orientation parameters using the model and that high levels of accuracy can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Recovering correct or at least realistic colors of underwater scenes is a very challenging issue for imaging techniques, since illumination conditions in a refractive and turbid medium as the sea are seriously altered. The need to correct colors of underwater images or videos is an important task required in all image-based applications like 3D imaging, navigation, documentation, etc. Many imaging enhancement methods have been proposed in literature for these purposes. The advantage of these methods is that they do not require the knowledge of the medium physical parameters while some image adjustments can be performed manually (as histogram stretching) or automatically by algorithms based on some criteria as suggested from computational color constancy methods. One of the most popular criterion is based on gray-world hypothesis, which assumes that the average of the captured image should be gray. An interesting application of this assumption is performed in the Ruderman opponent color space l$\alpha$$\beta$, used in a previous work for hue correction of images captured under colored light sources, which allows to separate the luminance component of the scene from its chromatic components. In this work, we present the first proposal for color correction of underwater images by using l$\alpha$$\beta$ color space. In particular, the chromatic components are changed moving their distributions around the white point (white balancing) and histogram cutoff and stretching of the luminance component is performed to improve image contrast. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method under gray-world assumption and supposing uniform illumination of the scene. Moreover, due to its low computational cost it is suitable for real-time implementation.},

@article{AbdulGhani2015,
abstract = {The physical properties of water cause light-induced degradation of underwater images. Light rapidly loses intensity as it travels in water, depending on the color spectrum wavelength. Visible light is absorbed at the longest wavelength first. Red and blue are the most and least absorbed, respectively. Underwater images with low contrast are captured due to the degradation effects of light spectrum. Therefore, the valuable information from these images cannot be fully extracted for further processing. The current study proposes a new method to improve the contrast and reduce the noise of underwater images. The proposed method integrates the modification of image histogram into two main color models, Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV). In the RGB color model, the histogram of the dominant color channel (i.e., blue channel) is stretched toward the lower level, with a maximum limit of 95{\%}, whereas the inferior color channel (i.e., red channel) is stretched toward the upper level, with a minimum limit of 5{\%}. The color channel between the dominant and inferior color channels (i.e., green channel) is stretched to both directions within the whole dynamic range. All stretching processes in the RGB color model are shaped to follow the Rayleigh distribution. The image is converted into the HSV color model, wherein the S and V components are modified within the limit of 1{\%} from the minimum and maximum values. Qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed method significantly enhances the image contrast, reduces the blue-green effect, and minimizes under- and over-enhanced areas in the output image. For quantitative analysis, the test with 300 underwater images shows that the proposed method produces average mean square error (MSE) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 76.76 and 31.13, respectively, which outperform six state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Coral reefs hosts nearly 25{\%} of all marine species and provide food sources for half a billion people worldwide while only a very small percentage have been surveyed. Advances in technology and processing along with affordable underwater cameras and Internet availability gives us the possibility to provide tools and softwares to survey entire coral reefs. Holistic ecological analyses of corals require not only the community view (10s to 100s of meters), but also the single colony analysis as well as corallite identification. As corals are three-dimensional, classical approaches to determine percent cover and structural complexity across spatial scales are inefficient, time-consuming and limited to experts. Here we propose an end-to-end approach to estimate these parameters using low-cost equipment (GoPro, Canon) and freeware (123D Catch, Meshmixer and Netfabb), allowing every community to participate in surveys and monitoring of their coral ecosystem. We demonstrate our approach on 9 species of underwater colonies in ranging size and morphology. 3D models of underwater colonies, fresh samples and bleached skeletons with high quality texture mapping and detailed topographic morphology were produced, and Surface Area and Volume measurements (parameters widely used for ecological and coral health studies) were calculated and analysed. Moreover, we integrated collected sample models with micro-photogrammetry models of individual corallites to aid identification and colony and polyp scale analysis.},

abstract = {Many coral reef fish species use mangrove and seagrass beds as nursery areas. However, in certain regions, the absence or scarcity of such habitats suggests that juvenile coral reef fish may be seeking refuge elsewhere. The underlying biogenic substratum of most coral reefs is structurally complex and provides many types of refuge. However, on young or subtropical coral reefs, species may be more reliant on the living coral layer as nursery areas. Such is the case on the high-latitude coral reefs of South Africa where the coral communities consist of a thin veneer of coral overlaying late Pleistocene bedrock. Thus, the morphology of coral species may be a major determinant in the availability of refuge space. Acropora austera is a branching species that forms large patches with high structural complexity. Associated with these patches is a diverse community of fish species, particularly juveniles. Over the past decade, several large ({\textgreater}100 m2) A. austera patches at Sodwana Bay have been diminishing for unknown reasons and there is little evidence of their replacement or regrowth. Seven patches of A. austera (AP) and non-A. austera (NAP) were selected and monitored for 12 months using visual surveys to investigate the importance of AP as refugia and nursery areas. There were significant differences in fish communities between AP and NAP habitats. In total, 110 species were recorded within the patches compared to 101 species outside the patches. Labrids and pomacentrids were the dominant species in the AP habitats, while juvenile scarids, acanthurids, chaetodons and serranids were also abundant. The diversity and abundance of fish species increased significantly with AP size. As the most structurally complex coral species on the reefs, the loss of APs may have significant implications for the recruitment and survival of certain fish species.},

abstract = {Documentation of maritime heritage is essential for its protection, and for reference in restoration and renovation processes. These functions become problematic in the case of historical ships and boats that lack lines drawings. The purpose of this paper is to describe a procedure for creation of lines drawings based on the shape analysis of surviving historical boats or their small-scale models with the help of reverse engineering (RE) techniques. The paper describes how digital photogrammetry and the iterative method were used to analyze the shape of three historical boats: Tomahawk, Refola and Nada. The application of the proposed procedure produced the lines drawings of the boats as its result. The accuracy of the 3D CAD model obtained with the photogrammetric technique was verified by comparing it against a more accurate 3D model produced with the help of a RE laser scanner. The examination of the resulting lines drawings proves that the digital photogrammetry process and the proposed iterative method are adequate tools for developing lines plans of boat models. The research offers the methodological basis for the creation of an archive of lines drawings of historical boats. Such an archive would provide reference for philologically correct restorations, and permit definition and classification of distinctive elements of various types of historical boats, particularly those produced in the Campania Region. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Results using a coral reef habitat were compared to surveys conducted with traditional snorkelling methods for benthic cover, holothurian counts, and coral health. Results were comparable between the two methods, and structure from motion allows the results to be analysed off-site for any chosen visual analysis.

abstract = {The relationship between the coral genotype and the environment is an important area of research in degraded coral reef ecosystems. We used a reciprocal outplanting experiment with 930 corals representing ten genotypes on each of eight reefs to investigate the influ-ence of genotype and the environment on growth and survivorship in the threatened Carib-bean staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis. Coral genotype and site were strong drivers of coral growth and individual genotypes exhibited flexible, non-conserved reaction norms, complemented by ten-fold differences in growth between specific G-E combinations. Growth plasticity may diminish the influence of local adaptation, where foreign corals grew faster than native corals at their home sites. Novel combinations of environment and geno-type also significantly affected disturbance response during and after the 2015 bleaching event, where these factors acted synergistically to drive variation in bleaching and recovery. Importantly, small differences in temperature stress elicit variable patterns of survivorship based on genotype and illustrate the importance of novel combinations of coral genetics and small differences between sites representing habitat refugia. In this context, acclimati-zation and flexibility is especially important given the long lifespan of corals coping with com-plex environmental change. The combined influence of site and genotype creates short-term differences in growth and survivorship, contributing to the standing genetic variation needed for adaptation to occur over longer timescales and the recovery of degraded reefs through natural mechanisms.},

abstract = {For many species securing territories is important for feeding and reproduction. Factors such as competition, habitat availability, and male characteristics can influence an individual's ability to establish and maintain a territory. The risk of predation can have an important influence on feeding and reproduction; however, few have studied its effect on territoriality. We investigated territoriality in a haremic, polygynous species of coral reef herbivore, Sparisoma aurofrenatum (redband parrotfish), across eight reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary that were either protected or unprotected from fishing of piscivorous fishes. We examined how territory size and quality varied with reef protection status, competition, predation risk, and male size. We then determined how territory size and quality influenced harem size and female size to understand the effect of territoriality on reproductive potential. We found that protected reefs trended towards having more large predatory fishes and that territories there were smaller but had greater algal nutritional quality relative to unprotected reefs. Our data suggest that even though males in protected sites have smaller territories, which support fewer females, they may improve their reproductive potential by choosing nutritionally rich areas, which support larger females. Thus, reef protection appears to shape the trade-off that herbivorous fishes make between territory size and quality. Furthermore, we provide evidence that males in unprotected sites, which are generally less complex than protected sites, choose territories with higher structural complexity, suggesting the importance of this type of habitat for feeding and reproduction in S. aurofrenatum. Our work argues that the loss of corals and the resulting decline in structural complexity, as well as management efforts to protect reefs, could alter the territory dynamics and reproductive potential of important herbivorous fish species.},

abstract = {— We present HPP, a software designed for com-plex classes of motion planning problems, such as navigation among movable objects, manipulation, contact-rich multiped locomotion, or elastic rods in cluttered environments. HPP is an open-source answer to the lack of a standard framework for these important issues for robotics and graphics communities. HPP adopts a clear object oriented architecture, which makes it easy to implement parts of an existing planning algorithm, or entirely new algorithms. Python bindings and a visualization tool allow for fast problem setting and prototyping: a new algorithm can be implemented in just a few lines of code. HPP can be used for classic planning problems such as pick and place for mobile robots, but is specifically designed to solve problems where the motion of the robot is con-strained. Examples of behaviors produced by HPP thanks to a generic constraint formulation include: maintaining a relative orientation between bodies, enforcing the static equilibrium of the robot, or automatically inferring that an object must be moved to allow locomotion. Constraints are tied to a custom representation of the kinematic chain, compatible with the Unified Robot Description format (URDF). To illustrate the possibilities of HPP, we present several recent scientific contributions implemented with HPP, most of which are provided with Python tutorials. HPP aims at being seamlessly integrated within a global robot control loop: Pinocchio, the fast multi-body dynamics library, is currently being integrated in HPP, thus bridging the gap between the planning and control communities.},

abstract = {Underwater applications of photogrammetric measurement techniques usually need to deal with multimedia photogrammetry aspects, which are characterized by the necessity of handling optical rays that are refracted at interfaces between optical media with different refractive indices according to Snell's Law. This so-called multimedia geometry has to be incorporated into geometric models in order to achieve correct measurement results. The paper shows a flexible yet strict geometric model for the handling of refraction effects on the optical path, which can be implemented as a module into photogrammetric standard tools such as spatial resection, spatial intersection, bundle adjustment or epipolar line computation. The module is especially well suited for applications, where an object in water is observed by cameras in air through one or more planar glass interfaces, as it allows for some simplifications here. In the second part of the paper, several aspects, which are relevant for an assessment of the accuracy potential in underwater/multimedia photogrammetry, are discussed. These aspects include network geometry and interface planarity issues as well as effects caused by refractive index variations and dispersion and diffusion under water. All these factors contribute to a rather significant degradation of the geometric accuracy potential in underwater/multimedia photogrammetry. In practical experiments, a degradation of the quality of results by a factor two could be determined under relatively favorable conditions.},

The properties of water cause attenuation of light travels through the water medium, resulting in low contrast, blur, inhomogeneous lighting, and color diminishing of the underwater images. This paper proposes a method of enhancing the quality of underwater image. The proposed method consists of two stages. At the first stage, the contrast correction technique is applied to the image, where the image is applied with the modified Von Kries hypothesis and stretching the image into two different intensity images at the average value with respects to Rayleigh distribution. At the second stage, the color correction technique is applied to the image where the image is first converted into hue-saturation-value (HSV) color model. The modification of the color component increases the image color performance. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of contrast, details, and noise reduction.},

abstract = {Caribbean coral reefs are becoming structurally simpler, largely due to human impacts. The consequences of this trend for reef-associated communities are currently unclear, but expected to be profound. Here, we assess whether changes in fish assemblages have been non-random over several decades of declining reef structure. More specifically, we predicted that species that depend exclusively on coral reef habitat (i.e., habitat specialists) should be at a disadvantage compared to those that use a broader array of habitats (i.e., habitat generalists). Analysing 3727 abundance trends of 161 Caribbean reef-fishes, surveyed between 1980 and 2006, we found that the trends of habitat-generalists and habitat-specialists differed markedly. The abundance of specialists started to decline in the mid-1980s, reaching a low of {\~{}}60{\%} of the 1980 baseline by the mid-1990s. Both the average and the variation in abundance of specialists have increased since the early 2000s, although the average is still well below the baseline level of 1980. This modest recovery occurred despite no clear evidence of a regional recovery in coral reef habitat quality in the Caribbean during the 2000s. In contrast, the abundance of generalist fishes remained relatively stable over the same three decades. Few specialist species are fished, thus their population declines are most likely linked to habitat degradation. These results mirror the observed trends of replacement of specialists by generalists, observed in terrestrial taxa across the globe. A significant challenge that arises from our findings is now to investigate if, and how, such community-level changes in fish populations affect ecosystem function.},

abstract = {One striking feature of coral reef ecosystems is the complex benthic architecture which supports diverse and abundant fauna, particularly of reef fish. Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide, with a corresponding loss of live coral cover resulting in a loss of architectural complexity. Understanding the dynamics of the reef architecture is therefore important to envision the ability of corals to maintain functional habitats in an era of climate change. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of reef topographic complexity for contemporary Caribbean reefs. The model describes the dynamics of corals and other benthic taxa under climate-driven disturbances (hurricanes and coral bleaching). Corals have a simplified shape with explicit diameter and height, allowing species-specific calculation of their colony surface and volume. Growth and the mechanical (hurricanes) and biological erosion (parrotfish) of carbonate skeletons are important in driving the pace of extension/reduction of the upper reef surface, the net outcome being quantified by a simple surface roughness index (reef rugosity). The model accurately simulated the decadal changes of coral cover observed in Cozumel (Mexico) between 1984 and 2008, and provided a realistic hindcast of coral colony-scale (1-10 m) changing rugosity over the same period. We then projected future changes of Caribbean reef rugosity in response to global warming. Under severe and frequent thermal stress, the model predicted a dramatic loss of rugosity over the next two or three decades. Critically, reefs with managed parrotfish populations were able to delay the general loss of architectural complexity, as the benefits of grazing in maintaining living coral outweighed the bioerosion of dead coral skeletons. Overall, this model provides the first explicit projections of reef rugosity in a warming climate, and highlights the need of combining local (protecting and restoring high grazing) to global (mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions) interventions for the persistence of functional reef habitats.

Although many reef-building corals are likely to decline, some weedy opportunistic species might increase in abundance. Here we explore whether the reshuffling of species can maintain ecosystem integrity and functioning. Using four common Caribbean reef-building coral genera we modeled rates of reef construction and complexity. We show that shifting coral assemblages result in rapid losses in coral-community calcification and reef rugosity that are independent of changes in the total abundance of reef corals. These losses are considerably higher than those recently attributed to climate change. Dominance patterns of coral assemblages seem to be the most important driver of the functioning of coral reefs and thus, the future of these ecosystems might depend not only on reductions of local and global stressors, but also on the maintenance of keystone coral species.},

abstract = {Seagrass meadows are regularly used by fish as resident, transient, or nursery habitat. However, there is a long-standing debate on how spatial variability of seagrass fish assemblages is determined. We examined the influence of seagrass structural complexity, physical water conditions, and proximity of neighboring shallow-water habitats on tropical fish assemblage composition in a shallow seagrass-dominated embayment at Zanzibar Island in the western Indian Ocean. Sampling of fish assemblages was carried out in seagrass meadows dominated by Enhalus acoroides or Thalassia hemprichii (3 localities each), 1 mixed meadow, and 1 unvegetated area. Overall, the density and biomass of fish were dominated by juvenile and subadult herbivores, either stationary seagrass residents or fish associated with coral reef and seagrass habitats. In terms of number of fish species, the majority were either carnivorous or omnivorous, and mainly coral-seagrass-associated. Multiple regression analysis indicated that canopy height was the foremost predictor for density, biomass, and species richness of juvenile fish, whereas adult and subadult fish densities were predicted by water depth. Moreover, distance-based correlation analyses revealed that fish assemblage structure was significantly correlated with the distance to neighboring mangrove and coral-reef habitats, shoot density, and (although weaker) canopy height. Based on these findings, attributes of seagrass structure and the location of a seagrass habitat within the seascape context appear to be important determinants of spatial patterns and variability of seagrass fish assemblages. This kind of information is important for spatial coastal management and for the selection of marine protected areas.},

abstract = {Habitat structural complexity is often considered beneficial for prey species because it reduces the foraging efficiency of predators. However, for site-attached, territorial prey, such as many damselfishes, structural complexity at specific scales may be detrimental. Since the location of territorial prey could be highly predictable to predators, the ability of such prey to detect approaching predators may be limited by high-relief structural complexity. The bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus is abundant and randomly dispersed on coral heads in fore reef habitats in the Florida Keys but is less abundant on back reef habitats, where it aggregates in open patches within fields of gorgonian soft corals. We hypothesized that the complex gorgonian habitat limits the visual field for S. partitus, increasing the uncertainty about predation risk, and is therefore a low quality habitat. We found that males occupy territories with visual fields larger than the fields around randomly selected points. Experimentally reducing the visual field around males decreased both their courting rates and the distance they ventured away from the nest. Males in the back reef spent more time away from their nests-potentially taking greater risks-towards the peak of the spawning cycle than males in the fore reef, which may be related to their lower reproductive success on the back reef. Experiments exposing male S. partitus to a fish predator suggest that a limited visual field (an uncertain situation) presents a more risky situation than a clearly visible but 'contained' predator. Our results demonstrate that a limited visual field around territorial, site-attached prey fish alters their behavior such that mating and feeding may be compromised. Fish abundance was negatively correlated with soft coral density but not with the number of potential territories or surface rugosity, suggesting that the visual seascape may be important for the fish distribution patterns. We suggest that habitat complexity at the appropriate scale mediates the distribution and possibly also the abundance of territorial prey fishes through the effects of the size of the visual field on fish behavior.},

The structures were polyethylene tube bundles with tube diameters of 3, 12 and 24 mm and a mixed treatment composed of all 3 tube sizes. We counted and identified mobile macrofauna that colonized the interior of the tubes and divided them into 3 body width categories: small ({\textless} 3 mm), medium (3-12 mm) and large ({\textgreater} 12 mm). Medium and large fauna were excluded from 3 mm tubes, and large fauna were excluded from 12 mm tubes. Small fauna were significantly more abundant in 24 mm tubes compared with 3 mm tubes, with intermediate abundance in 12 mm tubes. A second experiment determined that small fauna probably responded positively to tube interior volume, or responded to differences in hydrodynamic properties between the treatments. Medium fauna were more likely to be found in 12 mm tubes that matched their own body width than in 24 mm tubes. Species richness was significantly lower in the 3 mm tubes compared with the other treatments, in part because errant polychaetes, gastropods, caprellid amphipods and crabs were less likely to be found in the 3 mm tubes. These results indicate that habitats with very narrow inter-structural space sizes may be 'too complex' and may exclude certain fauna, resulting in decreased species richness. Also, some fauna may prefer habitats with intermediate space sizes that match their own body width.},

abstract = {The production of topographic datasets is of increasing interest and application throughout the geomorphic sciences, and river science is no exception. Consequently, a wide range of topographic measurement methods have evolved. Despite the range of available methods, the production of high resolution, high quality digital elevation models (DEMs) requires a significant investment in personnel time, hardware and/or software. However, image-based methods such as digital photogrammetry have been decreasing in costs. Developed for the purpose of rapid, inexpensive and easy three-dimensional surveys of buildings or small objects, the ‘structure from motion' photogrammetric approach (SfM) is an image-based method which could deliver a methodological leap if transferred to geomorphic applications, requires little training and is extremely inexpensive. Using an online SfM program, we created high-resolution digital elevation models of a river environment from ordinary photographs produced from a workflow that takes advantage of free and open source software. This process reconstructs real world scenes from SfM algorithms based on the derived positions of the photographs in three-dimensional space. The basic product of the SfM process is a point cloud of identifiable features present in the input photographs. This point cloud can be georeferenced from a small number of ground control points collected in the field or from measurements of camera positions at the time of image acquisition. The georeferenced point cloud can then be used to create a variety of digital elevation products. We examine the applicability of SfM in the Pedernales River in Texas (USA), where several hundred images taken from a hand-held helikite are used to produce DEMs of the fluvial topographic environment. This test shows that SfM and low-altitude platforms can produce point clouds with point densities comparable with airborne LiDAR, with horizontal and vertical precision in the centimeter range, and with very low capital and labor costs and low expertise levels.

But due to the nature of the aforementioned sensors, this localization data is prone to drift. Instead, the stereo-vision Graph-SLAM clearly improves the localization data thanks to the additional pose constraints computed from visual (stereo) loop closings.

The absence of natural light complicates energy budget considerations for deep diving flash-equipped drones. Refraction effects influence geometric image formation considerations with respect to field of view and focus, while attenuation and scattering degrade the radiometric image quality and limit the effective visibility. As an improvement on the stated issues, we present an AUV-based optical system intended for autonomous visual mapping of large areas of the seafloor (square kilometers) in up to 6000 m water depth. We compare it to existing systems and discuss tradeoffs such as resolution vs. mapped area and show results from a recent deployment with 90,000 mapped square meters of deep ocean floor.},

This study integrated a set of existing multi-view, image-processing algorithms, to accurately compute metrics of structural complexity (e.g., ratio of surface to planar area) underwater solely from images. This framework resulted in accurate, high-speed 3D habitat reconstructions at scales ranging from small corals to reef-scapes (10s km2). Structural complexity was accurately quantified from both contemporary and historical image datasets across three spatial scales: (i) branching coral colony (Acropora spp.); (ii) reef area (400 m2); and (iii) reef transect (2 km). At small scales, our method delivered models with {\textless}1 mm error over 90{\%} of the surface area, while the accuracy at transect scale was 85.3{\%} ± 6{\%} (CI). Advantages are: no need for an a priori requirement for image size or resolution, no invasive techniques, cost-effectiveness, and utilization of existing imagery taken from off-the-shelf cameras (both monocular or stereo). This remote sensing method can be integrated to reef monitoring and improve our knowledge of key aspects of coral reef dynamics, from reef accretion to habitat provisioning and productivity, by measuring and up-scaling estimates of structural complexity.},

abstract = {Most underwater vehicles are nowadays equipped with vision sensors. However, it is very likely that underwater images captured using optic cameras have poor visual quality due to lighting conditions in real-life applications. In such cases it is useful to apply image enhancement methods to increase visual quality of the images as well as enhance interpretability and visibility. In this paper, an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) based underwater image enhancement algorithm is presented for this purpose. In the proposed approach, initially each spectral component of an underwater image is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD. Then the enhanced image is constructed by combining the {\{}IMFs{\}} of spectral channels with different weights in order to obtain an enhanced image with increased visual quality. The weight estimation process is carried out automatically using a genetic algorithm that computes the weights of {\{}IMFs{\}} so as to optimize the sum of the entropy and average gradient of the reconstructed image. It is shown that the proposed approach provides superior results compared to conventional methods such as contrast stretching and histogram equalizing.},

abstract = {Objects look very different in the underwater environment compared to their appearance in sunlight. High quality images with correct colouring simplify the detection of underwater objects and may allow the use of visual SLAM algorithms developed for land-based robots underwater. Hence, image processing is required to obtain images of high quality and correct colouring. Current algorithms focus on the colour reconstruction of scenery at diving depth which has the advantage that a significant part of sunlight is still present and different colours can still be distinguished. At greater depth the filtering is much stronger such that this is no longer possible. In this study it is investigated whether machine learning can be used to transform image data. In order to obtain images under underwater lighting conditions in a controlled environment a special light source with a defined wavelength is used for illumination of test objects in a laboratory setup. The images are then fed through statistical learning algorithms with or without pre-filters. It is shown that k-nearest neighbour and support vector machines are most suitable for the given task and yield excellent results. Most difficult are the distinction between red and black / dark grey objects as well as coping with reflections.},

The accuracy of underwater 3D modelling is affected by more parameters than in single media cases. This study is part of a larger project on 3D measurements of temporal change of coral cover in tropical waters. It compares the accuracies of 3D point clouds generated by using images acquired from a system camera mounted in an underwater housing and the popular GoPro cameras respectively. A precisely measured calibration frame was placed in the target scene in order to provide accurate control information and also quantify the errors of the modelling procedure. In addition, several objects (cinder blocks) with various shapes were arranged in the air and underwater and 3D point clouds were generated by automated image matching. These were further used to examine the relative accuracy of the point cloud generation by comparing the point clouds of the individual objects with the objects measured by the system camera in air (the best possible values). Given a working distance of about 1.5 m, the GoPro camera can achieve a relative accuracy of 1.3 mm in air and 2.0 mm in water. The system camera achieved an accuracy of 1.8 mm in water, which meets our requirements for coral measurement in this system.},

abstract = {One of the main obstacles for biological assessments of coral reefs over large spatial scales is the ability to link data obtained at the laboratory scale to spatially large data sets. This is particularly the case when trying to assess the ecological function of microbial processes following dramatic large-scale events such as mass coral bleaching. To be able to infer ecological function of field corals from laboratory measurement standardised to surface area it is imperative to be able to measure the actual surface area of corals in-situ. There have been several approaches proposed to estimate the three-dimensional surface area of field corals. While these have been shown to be reliable for simple coral growth forms, large degrees of error are introduced when applying them to complex growth forms. This paper refines a technique for calculating the three-dimensional surface area based on the projected surface area, with errors associated with complex growth forms reduced to {\textless}{\^{a}}€ 5{\%}. Once developed, the simple mathematical relationship (called the surface index) can be used to estimate the three-dimensional surface area of field corals from photograph or video imagery, allowing physiological parameters of corals determined at the sub-colony scale to whole colony and spatially large data sets of coral reefs. The effectiveness of using laser scanning techniques to derive three-dimensional images of corals is also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper briefly reviews coral-algal phase shifts on coral reefs, with particular regard to summarizing the exogenous and endogenous factors in support of a proposed conceptual model, and to identifying critical information gaps. A phase shift occurs on a coral reef when the cover of a substrate by scleractinian corals is reduced in favor of macroalgal dominance, and resilience of the former condition is retarded because of ecological processes and/or environmental conditions. The change is often, but not always, associated with a perturbation such as coral bleaching, outbreaks of a coral-eating species, or storm damage. The new state is generally associated with some combination of reduced herbivory (from disease and/or fishing) and nutrient enrichment, although the relative importance of these factors is under debate and may vary among locations and even across single reefs. Disturbances that result in a state of generally low biotic three-dimensional structural complexity often precede a phase shift. Following such a disturbance, the system will pass to a state of higher biotic structural complexity, with either macroalgae or coral dominating. As the community progresses towards larger and more three-dimensionally complex corals or macroalgae, it exhibits greater resistance to shifting dominance from one state to the other. Studies of the phase-shift phenomena have been generally conducted at scales that are small relative to the sizes and inherent variability of whole coral reefs and systems of reefs. There is an urgent need for studies aimed at quantifying and simulating cause and effect aspects of the phase shift, including human-environment coupling, particularly in support of coral reef decision-making. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Our method allows problem-specific structural knowledge to be exploited for faster optimization by integrating with a user-defined importance sampling function. We demonstrate fast train times on two challenging large scale datasets for two very different problems: Image Net for multiclass classification and CUB-200-2011 for deformable part model training. Our method is shown to be 10-50 times faster than SVMstruct for cost-sensitive multiclass classification while being about as fast as the fastest 1-vs-all methods for multiclass classification. For deformable part model training, it is shown to be 50-1000 times faster than methods based on SVMstruct, mining hard negatives, and Pegasos-style stochastic gradient descent.

Thus DDFA features are inherently discriminative from the start even though they are trained without knowledge of the ultimate classification problem. Interestingly, DDFA also continues to add new features indefinitely (so it does not depend on a hidden layer size), is not based on minimizing error, and is inherently divergent instead of convergent, thereby providing a unique direction of research for unsupervised feature learning. In this paper the quality of its learned features is demonstrated on the MNIST dataset, where its performance confirms that indeed DDFA is a viable technique for learning useful features.},

The scan is completed in 50 ms corresponding to a 20 Hz scan rate. Light reflected from surface points within the field-of-view (FOV) is detected and converted to relative position and intensity at each scan angle. The position information is used to compute the depth coordinate of the point of reflection from a knowledge of the system geometry. Initial results indicate that an angular resolution of 200 by 200 points minimum is achievable over a ±45 degree FOV while maintaining a depth resolution of 1 millimeter at a 1 m nominal range.

abstract = {As international trade is getting prosperous, commercial ports need to accommodate hundreds of vessels everyday. When a vessel berths the wharf carelessly, it is possible to cause some damage to the pier beneath the waterline without leaving any evidence. Generally, scuba divers are sent down with camera to take photos or video tapes of the underwater structure for further studies of the damage. We propose using a laser light stripe technique to overcome the problem of turbid water. From geometry we know that a straight line projected to a plane remains a straight line. On the other hand, if there are any concave or convex features on the plane, the projected line will deform accordingly. So we can extract information, such as position or depth of the concavity, from the deformation of the projected line. In our study, we project a laser beam stripe on the target and use a CCD camera to capture the image. With image processing, we can extract the profile of the cross section, thus, the overall 3D $\backslash$nmeasurement of the target. We verify this idea with different shapes of objects submerged in different levels of turbid water in a test tank. Preliminary results indicate that this device can detect narrow gaps of 1 cm in NTU level 2.5 foul water from a distance of 60 cm with coverage of 60 cm wide},

A ROV mounted camera and inclined 532 nm sheet laser were used to create profiles of the bottom that were then merged into maps using platform navigation data. These initial results show very promising resolution in comparison to multibeam and stereo reconstructions, particularly in low contrast scenes. At the test sites shown here there were no significant complications related to scattering or attenuation of the laser sheet by the water. The resulting terrain was gridded at 0.25 cm and shows overall centimeter level definition. The largest source of error was related to the calibration of the laser and camera geometry. Results from three small areas show the highest resolution 3D models of a submerged archaeological site to date and demonstrate that laser imaging will be a viable method for accurate three dimensional site mapping and documentation.},

Segment saliences introduces salience values for contour segments, making it possible to use an optimal matching algorithm as distance function. The proposed descriptors are compared with convex contour saliences, curvature scale space, and beam angle statistics using a fish database with 11,000 images organized in 1100 distinct classes.

abstract = {The Levenberg-Marquardt method is a standard technique used to solve nonlin- ear least squares problems. Least squares problems arise when fitting a parameterized function to a set of measured data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors between the data points and the function. Nonlinear least squares problems arise when the function is not linear in the parameters. Nonlinear least squares meth- ods involve an iterative improvement to parameter values in order to reduce the sum of the squares of the errors between the function and the measured data points. The Levenberg-Marquardt curve-fitting method is actually a combination of two minimiza- tion methods: the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton method. In the gradient descent method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by updating the pa- rameters in the direction of the greatest reduction of the least squares objective. In the Gauss-Newton method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by assuming the least squares function is locally quadratic, and finding the minimum of the quadratic. The Levenberg-Marquardt method acts more like a gradient-descent method when the pa- rameters are far from their optimal value, and acts more like the Gauss-Newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value. This document describes these methods and illustrates the use of software to solve nonlinear least squares curve-fitting problems.},

Constructing a posture tracking system with the form factor suitable for human wear requires the development of miniature units that can be attached to the limb segments of interest in an unobtrusive way. Simultaneously, fast algorithms that can produce real-time posture estimates at sufficient rates are needed. In this paper, we focus on the development of efficient and accurate algorithms that compute the human posture information from low-cost miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. We present a new technique that computes posture estimates from the sensor data 23.8 times faster than the most efficient previously proposed technique, and simultaneously increases the accuracy of the estimates.},

To perform this task inertial/magnetic sensors generally contain: three orthogonally mounted angular rate sensors, three orthogonally mounted accelerometers, and three orthogonally mounted magnetometers. These sensors must be small and light enough to be securely attached to major limb segments and avoid user encumbrance. Sensor data must be processed by an efficient filtering algorithm that is able to produce accurate orientation estimates without singularities in all attitudes and does not require still periods to correct for drift. This paper discusses the design of a sourceless body tracking system with an emphasis on sensor and efficient filter design. Various methods for mitigating small transient orientation errors due to variability in the direction of the local magnetic field vector are also described.},

abstract = {Numerous applications require a self-contained personal navigation system that works in indoor and outdoor environments, does not require any infrastructure support, and is not susceptible to jamming. Posture tracking with an array of inertial/magnetic sensors attached to individual human limb segments has been successfully demonstrated. The "sourceless" nature of this technique makes possible full body posture tracking in an area of unlimited size with no supporting infrastructure. Such sensor modules contain three orthogonally mounted angular rate sensors, three orthogonal linear accelerometers and three orthogonal magnetometers. This paper describes a method for using accelerometer data combined with orientation estimates from the same modules to calculate position during walking and running. The periodic nature of these motions includes short periods of zero foot velocity when the foot is in contact with the ground. This pattern allows for precise drift error correction. Relative position is calculated through double integration of drift corrected accelerometer data. Preliminary experimental results for various types of motion including walking, side stepping, and running document accuracy of distance and position estimates.},

abstract = {Image enhancement has been an area of active research for decades. Most of the studies are aimed at improving the quality of image for better visualization. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is a technique to enhance the visibility of local details of an image by increasing the contrast of local regions. The algorithm is extensively used by various researches for applications in medical imagery. The drawback of CLAHE algorithm is the fact that it is not automatic and needs two input parameters viz., N size of the sub window and CL the clip limit for the method to work. Unfortunately none of the researchers have done the automatic selection of N and CL to make the algorithm suitable for any autonomous system. This paper proposes a novel extension of the conventional CLAHE algorithm, where N and CL are calculated automatically from the given image data itself thereby making the algorithm fully adaptive. Our proposed algorithm is used to study the enhancement of aerial, medical and underwater images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, a set of quality metric parameters are used. In the conventional CLAHE algorithm, we vary the value of N and CL and use the quality metric parameters to obtain the best output for a given combination of N and CL. It is observed that for a given set input images, the best results obtained using conventional CLAHE algorithm exactly matches with the results obtained using our algorithm, where N and CL are calculated automatically.},

abstract = {The ventral visual pathway implements object recognition and categorization in a hierarchy of processing areas with neuronal selectivities of increasing complexity. The presence of massive feedback connections within this hierarchy raises the possibility that normal visual processing relies on the use of computational loops. It is not known, however, whether object recognition can be performed at all without such loops (i.e., in a purely feed-forward mode). By analyzing the time course of reaction times in a masked natural scene categorization paradigm, we show that the human visual system can generate selective motor responses based on a single feed-forward pass. We confirm these results using a more constrained letter discrimination task, in which the rapid succession of a target and mask is actually perceived as a distractor. We show that a masked stimulus presented for only 26 msecand often not consciously perceivedcan fully determine the earliest selective motor responses: The neural representations of the stimulus and mask are thus kept separated during a short period corresponding to the feedforward sweep. Therefore, feedback loops do not appear to be mandatory for visual processing. Rather, we found that such loops allow the masked stimulus to reverberate in the visual system and affect behavior for nearly 150 msec after the feed-forward sweep.},

abstract = {We propose a novel direct sparse visual odometry formulation. It combines a fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry -- represented as inverse depth in a reference frame -- and camera motion. This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. Since our method does not depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, it can naturally sample pixels from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or smooth intensity variations on mostly white walls. The proposed model integrates a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting, and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three different datasets comprising several hours of video. The experiments show that the presented approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art direct and indirect methods in a variety of real-world settings, both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.},

Species presence and richness of different taxa were visually quantified in one hundred 25-m(2) plots in three marine reserves in the Caribbean. Sampling was evenly distributed across five levels of visually estimated reef complexity, with five structural components also recorded: the number of corals, number of large corals, slope angle, maximum sponge and maximum octocoral height. Taking advantage of natural heterogeneity in structural complexity within a particular coral reef habitat (Orbicella reefs) and discrete environmental envelope, thus minimizing other sources of variability, the relative importance of reef complexity and structural components was quantified for different taxa and individual fish and coral species on Caribbean coral reefs using boosted regression trees (BRTs). Boosted regression tree models performed very well when explaining variability in total (82{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}), coral (80{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}) and fish species richness (77{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}), for which the greatest declines in richness occurred below intermediate reef complexity levels. Complexity accounted for very little of the variability in octocorals, sponges, arthropods, annelids or anemones. BRTs revealed species-specific variability and importance for reef complexity and structural components. Coral and fish species occupancy generally declined at low complexity levels, with the exception of two coral species (Pseudodiploria strigosa and Porites divaricata) and four fish species (Halichoeres bivittatus, H. maculipinna, Malacoctenus triangulatus and Stegastes partitus) more common at lower reef complexity levels. A significant interaction between country and reef complexity revealed a non-additive decline in species richness in areas of low complexity and the reserve in Puerto Rico. Flattening of Caribbean coral reefs will result in substantial species losses, with few winners. Individual structural components have considerable value to different species, and their loss may have profound impacts on population responses of coral and fish due to identity effects of key species, which underpin population richness and resilience and may affect essential ecosystem processes and services.},

abstract = {A commonly ignored problem in planar mosaics, yet often present in practice, is the selection of a reference homography reprojection frame where to attach the successive image frames of the mosaic. A bad choice for the reference frame can lead to severe distortions in the mosaic and can degenerate in incorrect configurations after some sequential frame concatenations. This problem is accentuated in uncontrolled underwater acquisition setups as those provided by AUVs or ROVs due to both the noisy trajectory of the acquisition vehicle - with roll and pitch shakes - and to the non-flat nature of the seabed which tends to break the planarity assumption implicit in the mosaic construction. These scenarios can also introduce other undesired effects, such as light variations between successive frames, scattering and attenuation, vignetting, flickering and noise. This paper proposes a novel mosaicing pipeline, also including a strategy to select the best reference homography in planar mosaics from video sequences which minimizes the distortions induced on each image by the mosaic homography itself. Moreover, a new non-linear color correction scheme is incorporated to handle strong color and luminosity variations among the mosaic frames. Experimental evaluation of the proposed method on real, challenging underwater video sequences shows the validity of the approach, providing clear and visually appealing mosaics.},

abstract = {Growth rates of deep-water corals provide important information on the recovery potential of these ecosystems, for example from fisheries-induced impacts. Here, we present in situ growth dynamics that are currently largely unknown for deep-water octocorals, calculated by applying a non-destructive method. Videos of a boulder harbouring multiple colonies of Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis in the Northeast Channel Coral Conservation Area at the entrance to the Gulf of Maine at 863 m depth were collected in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Photogrammetric reconstructions of the boulder and the fauna yielded georeferenced 3D models for all sampling years. Repeated measurements of total length and cross-sectional area of the same colonies allowed the observation of growth dynamics. Growth rates of total length of Paragorgia arborea decreased over time with higher rates between 2006 and 2010 than between 2010 and 2014, while growth rates of cross-sectional area remained com-paratively constant. A general trend of decreasing growth rates of total length with size of the coral colony was documented. While no growth was observed for the largest colony (165 cm in length) between 2010 and 2014, a colony 50–65 cm in length grew 3.7 cm yr -1 between 2006 and 2010. Minimum growth rates of 1.6–2.7 cm yr -1 were estimated for two recruits ($\backslash$23 cm in 2014) of Primnoa resedaeformis. We successfully extracted bio-logically meaningful data from photogrammetric models and present the first in situ growth rates for these coral species in the Northwest Atlantic.},

abstract = {* In order to understand physiological, ecological and biological processes, it is often crucial to determine an organism's volume and surface area (SA). Most of the available methods require sacrificing the organism or at least removing it from its natural habitat, in order to measure these parameters. Advances in computer vision algorithms now allow us to determine these parameters using non-destructive, three-dimensional modelling. The addition of cloud computing and the availability of freeware make this tool widely accessible. * Photographs of corals and sponges were taken in natura and used to create digital 3D models using the ‘structure-from-motion' technique. Modelling was done online using 123D Catch freeware (Autodesk Inc.). Volume and SA of the corals and sponges were calculated from these 3D models. * Comparing in situ 3D modelling to current measuring methods (e.g. water displacement, paraffin dipping) showed that volume calculation by 3D modelling gave fast results accurate to within 8{\%} of estimated true volume. Using cloud computing enabled the creation of a 3D model in {\textless}30 min. SA accuracy was found to differ significantly, depending on the shape of the modelled object, with an accuracy ranging widely from 2{\%} to 18{\%}. * We found that in situ volume and SA measurements created by 3D modelling enable easy, fast and non-intrusive studies of benthic aquatic organisms, without removing the subject organisms from their habitat, thus enabling continuous study of natural growth over extended time periods. The freely available freeware, along with ease of use, makes this method accessible to many areas of research.},

abstract = {Over the past 15 years, multiple areas in the North Atlantic have been closed to destructive fishing practices to protect vulnerable deep-water coral ecosystems, known to provide habitat for diverse associated fauna. Despite the growing number of conservation measures, long-term studies on the recovery of deep-water coral communities from fisheries impacts remain scarce. In the Gulf of Maine, the Northeast Channel Coral Conservation Area (NECCCA). 1 1NECCCA: Northeast Channel Coral Conservation Area. was established in 2002 to protect dense aggregations of the two numerically dominant octocoral species in the region, Primnoa resedaeformis and Paragorgia arborea. To evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation measures, we monitored shifts in abundance and size of these two coral species in the shallow section (400-700. m) of the NECCCA for 12 years after the fisheries closure. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the location of the deep boundaries of the NECCCA that were placed based on a precautionary approach with limited information on coral distribution at depths {\textgreater}500. m. Video transects were conducted with ROV "ROPOS" in 2001, 2006, 2010 and 2014. We found potential signs of recovery from fisheries impact at some of the shallow locations in 2014: higher coral abundance and the presence of some very large colonies as well as recruits compared to 2001 and 2006. However, spatial heterogeneity was pronounced and small colonies ({\textless}20. cm) indicative of successful recruitment were not found at all sites, underscoring the need for long-term protection measures to allow full recovery of impacted coral communities. At 700-1500. m different coral taxa were dominant than at the shallow locations and coral abundance peaked between 700 and1200. m. High abundance and diversity of corals at this depth range, 8-10. km southwest of the NECCCA, suggest that an extension of the southwest boundary should be considered. Comparably low coral abundance was found at depths of 1200-1500. m inside the NECCCA indicating an appropriate initial placement of the southeast boundary. These are the first long-term observations of protected deep-water octocoral communities which are needed for the effective management of deep-water coral conservation areas.},

abstract = {Eco-genetic individual-based models involve tracking the ecological dynamics of simulated individual organisms that are in part characterized by heritable parameters. We developed an eco-genetic individual-based model to explore ecological and evolutionary interactions of fish growth and maturation schedules. Our model is flexible and allows for exploration of the effects of heritable growth rates (based on von Bertalanffy and biphasic growth patterns), heritable maturation schedules (based on maturation reaction norm concepts), or both on individual- and population-level traits. In baseline simulations with rather simple ecological trade-offs and over a relatively short time period ({\textless}200 simulation years), simulated male and female fish evolve differential genetic growth and maturation. Further, resulting patterns of genetically determined growth and maturation are influenced by mortality rate and density-dependent processes, and maturation and growth parameters interact to mediate the evolution of one another. Subsequent to baseline simulations, we conducted experimental simulations to mimic fisheries harvest with two size-limits (targeting large or small fish), an array of fishing mortality rates, and assuming a deterministic or stochastic environment. Our results suggest that fishing with either size-limit may induce considerable changes in life-history trait expression (maturation schedules and growth rates), recruitment, and population abundance and structure. However, targeting large fish would cause more adverse genetic effects and may lead to a population less resilient to environmental stochasticity.

abstract = {—The goal of image restoration is to improve a given image in some predefined sense. Restoration attempts to recover an image by modelling the degradation function and applying the inverse process. Motion blur is a common type of degradation which is caused by the relative motion between an object and camera. Motion blur can be modeled by a point spread function consists of two parameters angle and length. Accurate estimation of these parameters is required in case of blind restoration of motion blurred images. This paper compares different approaches to estimate the parameters of a motion blur namely direction and length directly from the observed image with and without the influence of Gaussian noise. These estimated motion blur parameters can then be used in a standard non-blind deconvolution algorithm. Simulation results compare the performance of most common motion blur estimation methods.  Index Terms—motion blur, hough transform, radon transform, Cepstral transform},

abstract = {We present an approach for planning collision-free paths on-line for an underwater multi-robot system, which is composed by a leading Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) endowed with a multibeam sonar and high processing capabilities and a second AUV. While the leading AUV follows a safe, pre-planned survey path, the second vehicle, herein referred to as Camera Vehicle (CV), must survey the bottom in close proximity while following the leader, complementing its survey capabilities. Due to their proximity to the bottom, the CV is exposed to a collision threat. We address this problem by incrementally building a 3D map of the environment onboard the leading vehicle by means of its multibeam sonar. Using this map, we plan on-line 3D paths that are transferred to the CV for close and safe surveying of the bottom. These paths are planned using the Transition-based RRT (T-RRT) algorithm, which is an RRT-variant that considers a cost function defined over the vehicle's configuration space, or costmap for short. By defining a costmap in terms of distance to the bottom and path distance, we are able to keep the paths at a desired offset distance from the bottom for constant-resolution surveying. We have integrated our path planning system with the software architecture of the SPARUS-II and GIRONA500 AUVs. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in simulation. The multi-robot system presented is based on the context of the MORPH FP7 EU project.},

In particular, AUVs are becoming an attractive option for underwater search and survey operations as they are inexpensive compared to manned vehicles. Previous attempts on AUV designs have focused primarily on functional designs while very little research has been directed to identify optimum designs. This paper presents an optimization framework for the design of AUVs using two state-of-the-art population based optimization algorithms, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm (IDEA). The framework is subsequently used to identify the optimal design of a torpedo-shaped AUV with an overall length of 1.3. m. The preliminary design identified through the process of optimization is further analyzed with the help of a computer-aided design tool, CATIA to generate a detailed design. The detailed design has since then been built and is currently undergoing trials. The flexibility of the proposed framework and its ability to identify optimum preliminary designs of AUVs with different sets of user requirements are also demonstrated. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This affects the quality and reliability of image processing and therefore colour correction is a necessary pre-processing stage. In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised Colour Correction Method (UCM) for underwater image enhancement. UCM is based on colour balancing, contrast correction of RGB colour model and contrast correction of HSI colour model. Firstly, the colour cast is reduced by equalizing the colour values. Secondly, an enhancement to a contrast correction method is applied to increase the Red colour by stretching red histogram towards the maximum (i.e., right side), similarly the Blue colour is reduced by stretching the blue histogram towards the minimum (i.e., left side). Thirdly, the Saturation and Intensity components of the HSI colour model have been applied for contrast correction to increase the true colour using Saturation and to address the illumination problem through Intensity. We compare our results with three well known methods, namely Gray World, White Patch and Histogram Equalisation using Adobe Photoshop. The proposed method has produced better results than the existing methods.},

Two major issues are discussed in this paper. The first concerns deep-sea surveys using photogrammetry from a submarine. Here the goal was to obtain a set of images that completely covered the selected site. Subsequently and based on these images, a low-resolution 3D model is obtained in real-time, followed by a very high-resolution model produced back in the laboratory. The second issue involves the extraction of known artefacts present on the site. This aspect of the research is based on an a priori representation of the knowledge involved using systematic reasoning. Two parallel processes were developed to represent the photogrammetric process used for surveying as well as for identifying archaeological artefacts visible on the sea floor. Mapping involved the use of the CIDOC-CRM system (International Committee for Documentation (CIDOC)—Conceptual Reference Model)—This is a system that has been previously utilised to in the heritage sector and is largely available to the established scientific community. The proposed theoretical representation is based on procedural attachment; moreover, a strong link is maintained between the ontological description of the modelled concepts and the Java programming language which permitted 3D structure estimation and modelling based on a set of oriented images. A very recently discovered shipwreck acted as a testing ground for this project; the Xelendi Phoenician shipwreck, found off the Maltese coast, is probably the oldest known shipwreck in the western Mediterranean. The approach presented in this paper was developed in the scope of the GROPLAN project (G{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralisation du Relev{\'{e}}, avec Ontologies et Photogramm{\'{e}}trie, pour l'Arch{\'{e}}ologie Navale et Sous-marine).

abstract = {Over the past decade, several image mosaicing methods have been proposed in robotic mapping and remote sensing applications. Owing to rapid developments in obtaining optical data from areas beyond human reach, there is a high demand from different science fields for creating large-area image mosaics, often using images as the only source of information. One of the most important steps in the mosaicing process is motion estimation between overlapping images to obtain the topology, i.e., the spatial relationships between images. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for feature-based image mosaicing capable of obtaining the topology with a reduced number of matching attempts and of getting the best possible trajectory estimation. Innovative aspects include the use of a fast image similarity criterion combined with a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) solution, to obtain a tentative topology and information theory principles to decide when to update trajectory estimation. Unlike previous approaches for large-area mosaicing, our framework is able to naturally deal with the cases where time-consecutive images cannot be matched successfully, such as completely unordered sets. This characteristic also makes our approach robust to sensor failure. The performance of the method is illustrated with experimental results obtained from different challenging underwater image sequences. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In augmented reality, one of key tasks to achieve a convincing visual appearance consistency between virtual objects and video scenes is to have a coherent illumination along the whole sequence. As outdoor illumination is largely dependent on the weather, the lighting condition may change from frame to frame. In this paper, we propose a full image-based approach for online tracking of outdoor illumination variations from videos captured with moving cameras. Our key idea is to estimate the relative intensities of sunlight and skylight via a sparse set of planar feature-points extracted from each frame. To address the inevitable feature misalignments, a set of constraints are introduced to select the most reliable ones. Exploiting the spatial and temporal coherence of illumination, the relative intensities of sunlight and skylight are finally estimated by using an optimization process. We validate our technique on a set of real-life videos and show that the results with our estimations are visually coherent along the video sequences.},

Alongside these advances, visual mapping has become a very active research area, which facilitates the mapping of areas inaccessible to humans. This requires the efficient processing of data to increase the final mosaic quality and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient image mosaicing algorithm for large area visual mapping in underwater environments using multiple underwater robots. Our method identifies overlapping image pairs in the trajectories carried out by the different robots during the topology estimation process, being this a cornerstone for efficiently mapping large areas of the seafloor.

Both (EKF and UKF) navigation algorithms have been validated through experimental navigation data related to some sea tests performed in La Spezia (Italy) with one of Typhoon class vehicles during the NATO CommsNetl3 experiment (held in September 2013) and through Ultra-Short BaseLine (USBL) fixes used as a reference (ground truth). Typhoon is an AUV designed by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the Florence University for exploration and surveillance of underwater archaeological sites in the framework of the Italian THESAURUS project and the European ARROWS project. The obtained results have demonstrated the effectiveness of both navigation algorithms and the superiority of the UKF (very suitable for AUV navigation and, up to now, still not used much in this field) without increasing the computational load (affordable for on-line on-board AUV implementation).},

The eVO algorithm has been submitted to the KITTI odometry benchmark [1] where it ranks first at the date of submission, with an average translational drift of 1.93{\%} and an average angular drift of less than 0.076 degres/m. Besides, we have made several experiments with our MAV with egolocalization given by eVO, for instance for autonomous 3D environment modeling.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

The method generates dense, geometrically accurate recon- structions of underwater environments by compensating for image distortions due to refraction. A refractive model of the camera and enclosure is calculated offline using calibration images and produces non-linear epipolar curves for use in stereo matching. An efficient block matching algorithm traverses the precalculated epipolar curves to find pixel correspondences and depths are calculated using pixel ray tracing. Finally the depth maps are used to perform dense simultaneous localization and mapping to generate a 3D model of the environment. The localization and mapping algorithm incorporates refraction corrected ray tracing to improve map quality. The method is shown to improve overall depth map quality over existing methods and to generate high quality 3-D reconstructions.},

abstract = {Direct visual observations from submersible vehicles at hydrothermal vents typically only reveal a fraction of the vent environment at any one time. We describe the use of precision Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) videography to produce extensive mosaic images of hydrothermal vent chimneys and surrounding seafloor areas (c. 250m2), with sufficient resolution to determine distributions of macro- and megafauna. Doppler velocity log navigation (DVLNAV) was used to follow overlapping vertical survey lines in a fixed plane facing a vent chimney, while acquiring high-definition video imagery using a forward-looking camera. The DVLNAV also enabled the vehicle to follow overlapping horizontal survey lines while acquiring seafloor imagery from a downward-looking video camera and mapping variations in seawater temperature. Digital stills images extracted from video were used to compile high-resolution composite views of the surveyed areas. Applying these image acquisition techniques at vent fields on the East Scotia Ridge, Southern Ocean, revealed consistent patterns of faunal zonation around vent sources, variations in proportions of faunal assemblage types on different faces of a vent chimney, and differences in proportions of faunal assemblages between two different vent fields. The technique can therefore be used to determine the composition and spatial distribution of fauna across complex areas of topography, such as vent fields, where mosaic images of vertical structures cannot currently be acquired using other platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). These image acquisition techniques, demonstrated here in the first ROV dives at newly discovered vent fields, may offer an appropriate technology for rapid baseline studies required by the potential mining of seafloor massive sulfides (SMS). ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In some application fields, such as underwater archaeology or marine biology, there is the need to collect three-dimensional, close-range data from objects that cannot be removed from their site. In particular, 3D imaging techniques are widely employed for close-range acquisitions in underwater environment. In this work we have compared in water two 3D imaging techniques based on active and passive approaches, respectively, and whole-field acquisition. The comparison is performed under poor visibility conditions, produced in the laboratory by suspending different quantities of clay in a water tank. For a fair comparison, a stereo configuration has been adopted for both the techniques, using the same setup, working distance, calibration, and objects. At the moment, the proposed setup is not suitable for real world applications, but it allowed us to conduct a preliminary analysis on the performances of the two techniques and to understand their capability to acquire 3D points in presence of turbidity. The performances have been evaluated in terms of accuracy and density of the acquired 3D points. Our results can be used as a reference for further comparisons in the analysis of other 3D techniques and algorithms.},

abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and localization in underwater environments is particularly challenging due to the rapid attenuation of Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio-frequency signals. Underwater communications are low bandwidth and unreliable, and there is no access to a global positioning system. Past approaches to solve the AUV localization problem have employed expensive inertial sensors, used installed beacons in the region of interest, or required periodic surfacing of the AUV. While these methods are useful, their performance is fundamentally limited. Advances in underwater communications and the application of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology to the underwater realm have yielded new possibilities in the field. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of AUV navigation and localization, as well as a description of some of the more commonly used methods. In addition, we highlight areas of future research potential.},

abstract = {This paper describes a pose-based underwater 3D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using a multibeam echosounder to produce high consistency underwater maps. The proposed algorithm compounds swath profiles of the seafloor with dead reckoning localization to build surface patches (i.e., point clouds). An Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with a probabilistic implementation is then used to register the point clouds, taking into account their uncertainties. The registration process is divided in two steps: (1) point-to-point association for coarse registration and (2) point-to-plane association for fine registration. The point clouds of the surfaces to be registered are sub-sampled in order to decrease both the computation time and also the potential of falling into local minima during the registration. In addition, a heuristic is used to decrease the complexity of the association step of the ICP from O ( n 2 ) to O ( n ) . The performance of the SLAM framework is tested using two real world datasets: First, a 2.5D bathymetric dataset obtained with the usual down-looking multibeam sonar configuration, and second, a full 3D underwater dataset acquired with a multibeam sonar mounted on a pan and tilt unit.},

abstract = {Conventional underwater manipulation is performed by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with a rigidly connected multi-link arm. However, accurate manipulation requires the ROV to have excellent maneuverability, which limits the design flexibility and capabilities of the vehicle. This paper instead proposes the use of a small, deployable, and highly maneuverable agent ROV as an end effector, which is connected to the main vehicle by a flexible smart cable. This cable tracks the relative position of the agent, thus eliminating the need for additional positioning sensors and allowing significant size reduction for the agent. In addition, to compensate for the limited lifting capability of the small agent, it is equipped with active buoyancy control. The proposed system can be applied to common autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with minimal modification for coarse station-keeping. The whole system is operated as a conventional AUV under normal operating conditions, but the agent is deployed when manipulation or precise monitoring is necessary. Numerical simulations were performed for dynamic analysis and prototype design of the agent vehicle, and this design was implemented as a model-scale system for experiments in a test tank. This implementation confirmed the feasibility and potential capabilities of the proposed manipulation system concept. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel refractive calibration method for an underwater stereo camera system where both cameras are looking through multiple parallel flat refractive interfaces. At the heart of our method is an important finding that the thickness of the interface can be estimated from a set of pixel correspondences in the stereo images when the refractive axis is given. To our best knowledge, such a finding has not been studied or reported. Moreover, by exploring the search space for the refractive axis and using reprojection error as a measure, both the refractive axis and the thickness of the interface can be recovered simultaneously. Our method does not require any calibration target such as a checkerboard pattern which may be difficult to manipulate when the cameras are deployed deep undersea. The implementation of our method is simple. In particular, it only requires solving a set of linear equations of the form Ax = b and applies sparse bundle adjustment to refine the initial estimated results. Extensive experiments have been carried out which include simulations with and without outliers to verify the correctness of our method as well as to test its robustness to noise and outliers. The results of real experiments are also provided. The accuracy of our results is comparable to that of a state-of-the-art method that requires known 3D geometry of a scene.},

abstract = {Vessel groundings are a major source of disturbance to coral reefs worldwide. Documenting the extent of damage caused by groundings is a crucial first step in the reef restoration process. Here, we describe the appli- cation of a novel survey methodology, landscape video mosaics, to assessment of the damage caused by vessel groundings. Video mosaics, created by merging thousands of video frames, combine quantitative and qualita- tive aspects of damage assessment and provide a georeferenced, landscape, high-resolution, spatially accurate permanent record of an injury. The scar in a Florida reef impacted by a 49-foot vessel, imaged in 2005 and 2006, covered an area of 150 m2 (total imaged area was {\textgreater}600 m2 ). The impacted coral community showed limited signs of coral recovery more than 3 years after the initial impact; the cover of corals was still significantly high- er in the undamaged areas compared to the scar. However, seagrass colonization of the scar was observed. Finally, no evidence of further physical impacts was documented even when four hurricanes passed near the grounding site in 2005. The videomosaics developed in this study proved to be ideal tools to survey the ground- ing scars. Mosaics provide a means to collect information on the size of the damage area and the status and trends of the impacted biological communities and provide a permanent visual record of the damage, thereby expanding the quality and diversity of information that can be collected during field surveys.},

abstract = {Given the need to describe, analyze and index large quantities of marine imagery data for exploration and monitoring activities, a range of specialized image annotation tools have been developed worldwide. Image annotation ??? the process of transposing objects or events represented in a video or still image to the semantic level, may involve human interactions and computer-assisted solutions. Marine image annotation software (MIAS) have enabled over 500 publications to date. We review the functioning, application trends and developments, by comparing general and advanced features of 23 different tools utilized in underwater image analysis. MIAS requiring human input are basically a graphical user interface, with a video player or image browser that recognizes a specific time code or image code, allowing to log events in a time-stamped (and/or geo-referenced) manner. MIAS differ from similar software by the capability of integrating data associated to video collection, the most simple being the position coordinates of the video recording platform. MIAS have three main characteristics: annotating events in real time, posteriorly to annotation and interact with a database. These range from simple annotation interfaces, to full onboard data management systems, with a variety of toolboxes. Advanced packages allow to input and display data from multiple sensors or multiple annotators via intranet or internet. Posterior human-mediated annotation often include tools for data display and image analysis, e.g. length, area, image segmentation, point count; and in a few cases the possibility of browsing and editing previous dive logs or to analyze the annotations. The interaction with a database allows the automatic integration of annotations from different surveys, repeated annotation and collaborative annotation of shared datasets, browsing and querying of data. Progress in the field of automated annotation is mostly in post processing, for stable platforms or still images. Integration into available MIAS is currently limited to semi-automated processes of pixel recognition through computer-vision modules that compile expert-based knowledge. Important topics aiding the choice of a specific software are outlined, the ideal software is discussed and future trends are presented.},

abstract = {We present a novel method for planning 3D coverage paths for inspection of complex structures on the ocean floor (such as seamounts or coral reefs) using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Our method initially uses an a priori map to plan a nominal coverage path that allows the AUV to pass its sensors over all points on the target structure. We then go beyond previous approaches in the literature by considering the vehicle's position uncertainty rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption of an idealized path execution. To this aim, we present a replanning algorithm based on stochastic trajectory optimization that reshapes the nominal path to cope with the actual target structure perceived in situ. The replanning algorithm runs onboard the AUV in realtime during the inspection mission, adapting the path according to the measurements provided by the vehicle's range sensing sonars. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in experiments at sea using the GIRONA 500 AUV where we cover a $\backslash$nconcrete block of a breakwater structure in a harbor and an underwater boulder rising from 40 m up to 27 m depth. Moreover, we apply state-of-the-art surface reconstruction techniques to the data acquired by the AUV and obtain 3D models of the inspected structures that show the benefits of our planning method for 3D mapping. },

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

In this paper, we present an innovative 3-D reconstruction technique based on visual imagery as a non-intrusive, repeatable, in situ method for estimating physical parameters, such as surface area and volume for efficient assessment of longterm variability. The reconstruction algorithms are presented, and benchmarked using an existing data set. We validate the technique underwater, utilising a commercial-off-the-shelf camera and a piece of staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis. The resulting reconstruction is compared with a laser scan of the coral piece for assessment and validation. The comparison shows that 77{\%} of the pixels in the reconstruction are within 0.3 mm of the ground truth laser scan. Reconstruction results from an unknown video camera are also presented as a segue to future applications of this research.},

However, few sensor nets exist because commercially available underwater acoustic modems are too costly and energy inefficient to be practical for this applications. Therefore, when designing an acoustic modem for sensor networks, the designer must optimize for low cost and low energy consumption at every level, from the analog electronics, to the signal processing scheme, to the hardware platform. In this paper we focus on the design choice of hardware platform: digital signal processors, microcontrollers, or reconfigurable hardware, to optimize for energy efficiency while keeping costs low. We implement one algorithm used in an acoustic modem design - matching pursuits for channel estimation - on all three platforms and perform a design space exploration to compare the timing, power and energy consumption of each implementation. We show that the reconfigurable hardware implementation can provide a maximum of 210 X and 52 X decrease in energy consumption over the microcontroller and DSP implementations respectively.},

abstract = {This article presents a new open-source C++ implementation to solve the SLAM problem, which is focused on genericity, versatility and high execution speed. It is based on an original object oriented architecture, that allows the combination of numerous sensors and landmark types, and the integration of various approaches proposed in the literature. The system capacities are illustrated by the presentation of an inertial/vision SLAM approach, for which several improvements over existing methods have been introduced, and that copes with very high dynamic motions. Results with a hand-held camera are presented.},

abstract = {We present an approach for navigating in unknown environments while, simultaneously, gathering information for inspecting underwater structures using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). To accomplish this, we first use our pipeline for mapping and planning collision-free paths online, which endows an AUV with the capability to autonomously acquire optical data in close proximity. With that information, we then propose a reconstruction pipeline to create a photo-realistic textured 3D model of the inspected area. These 3D models are also of particular interest to other fields of study in marine sciences, since they can serve as base maps for environmental monitoring, thus allowing change detection of biological communities and their environment over time. Finally, we evaluate our approach using the Sparus II, a torpedo-shaped AUV, conducting inspection missions in a challenging, real-world and natural scenario.},

abstract = {Structure from Motion (SfM) generates high-resolution topography and coregistered texture (color) from an unstructured set of overlapping photographs taken from varying viewpoints, overcoming many of the cost, time, and logistical limitations of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and other topographic surveying methods. This paper provides the first investigation of SfM as a tool for mapping fault zone topography in areas of sparse or low-lying vegetation. First, we present a simple, affordable SfM workflow, based on an unmanned helium balloon or motorized glider, an inexpensive camera, and semiautomated software. Second, we illustrate the system at two sites on southern California faults covered by existing airborne or terrestrial LiDAR, enabling a comparative assessment of SfM topography resolution and precision. At the first site, an [{\~{}}]0.1 km2 alluvial fan on the San Andreas fault, a colored point cloud of density mostly {\textgreater}700 points/m2 and a 3 cm digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto were produced from 233 photos collected [{\~{}}]50 m above ground level. When a few global positioning system ground control points are incorporated, closest point vertical distances to the much sparser ([{\~{}}]4 points/m2) airborne LiDAR point cloud are mostly {\textless}3 cm. The second site spans an [{\~{}}]1 km section of the 1992 Landers earthquake scarp. A colored point cloud of density mostly {\textgreater}530 points/m2 and a 2 cm DEM and orthophoto were produced from 450 photos taken from [{\~{}}]60 m above ground level. Closest point vertical distances to existing terrestrial LiDAR data of comparable density are mostly {\textless}6 cm. Each SfM survey took [{\~{}}]2 h to complete and several hours to generate the scene topography and texture. SfM greatly facilitates the imaging of subtle geomorphic offsets related to past earthquakes as well as rapid response mapping or long-term monitoring of faulted landscapes.},

abstract = {The Arctic Ocean traditionally has been described as an ocean with low variability and weak turbulence levels. Many years of observations from ice camps and ice-based instruments have shown that the sea ice cover effectively isolates the water column from direct wind forcing and damps existing motions, resulting in relatively small upper-ocean variability and an internal wave field that is much weaker than at lower latitudes. Under the ice, direct and indirect estimates across the Arctic basins suggest that turbulent mixing does not play a significant role in the general distribution of oceanic properties and the evolution of Arctic water masses. However, during ice-free periods, the wind generates inertial motions and internal waves, and contributes to deepening of the mixed layer both on the shelves and over the deep basins-as at lower latitudes. Through their associated vertical mixing, these motions can alter the distribution of properties in the water column. With an increasing fraction of the Arctic Ocean becoming ice-free in summer and in fall, there is a crucial need for a better understanding of the impact of direct wind forcing on the Arctic Ocean.},

This Theme Section on the application of landscape ecology to the estuarine and coastal environment emerged from a special symposium at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 20th Biennial Conference (Estuaries and Coasts in a Changing World) held in Portland, Oregon, USA, in November 2009.

abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) do not result in consistent maps of large areas because of gradual increase of the uncertainty for long term missions. In addition, as the size of the map grows the computational cost increases, making SLAM solutions unsuitable for on-line applications. This thesis surveys SLAM approaches paying special attention to those approaches aimed to work on large scenarios. In addition, special focus is given to existing underwater SLAM applications. A technique based on using independent local maps together with a global stochastic map is then presented. This technique is called Selective Submap Joining SLAM (SSJS). A global map contains relative transformations between local maps, which are updated once a new loop is detected. Maps sharing several features are fused, maintaining the correlation between landmarks and vehicle's pose. The use of local maps reduces computational costs and improves map consistency. This approach is compared to state of the art techniques using the Victoria Park dataset, a well-known benchmark within SLAM community. Synthetic and experimental results show that SSJS approach is able to map large areas consistently with lower computational cost compared to state of the art methods. Once demonstrated the feasibility of SSJS, the method is adapted to be used on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In this thesis, two sets of experiments are presented: 1) the REMUS-100 AUV with a side-scan sonar, and 2) the SPARUS AUV with a down-looking camera. In both cases it is necessary to dene their corresponding motion and observation models. Moreover, imaging techniques are necessary in order to extract and match robust landmarks, necessary for SLAM algorithms to work. Experiments on real data demonstrate the capability to produce consistent localization and precise mapping by combining automatic landmark extraction with SSJS.},

abstract = {A nonlinear parametric model of a torque-controlled thruster is developed and experimentally confirmed. The model shows that the thruster behaves like a sluggish nonlinear filter, where the speed of response depends on the commanded thrust level. A quasi-linear analysis which utilizes describing functions shows that the dynamics of the thruster produce a strong bandwidth constraint and a limit cycle, which are both commonly seen in practice. Three forms of compensation are tested, utilizing a hybrid simulation combining an instrumented thruster with a real-time mathematical vehicle model. The first compensator, a linear lead network, is easy to implement and greatly improves performance over the uncompensated system, but does not perform uniformly over the entire operating range. The second compensator, which attempts to cancel the nonlinear effect of the thruster, is effective over the entire operating range but depends on an accurate thruster model. The final compensator, an adaptive sliding controller, is effective over the entire operating range and can compensate for uncertainties or the degradation of the thruster},

abstract = {The lionfish (Pterois volitans), has become an abundant alien species along the southeast coast of the United States of America and in Caribbean coastal waters. Although, they represent a major concern in conservation, no studies have yet assessed their population ecology and genetic structure simultaneously. We collected 227 lionfish from 24 sites around Puerto Rico to investigate, the length distribution, length-weight relationships, relative condition factor, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic diversity. The total length distribution ranged between 37 and 349 mm with a single peak between 130 and 149 mm. Our analysis indicated isometric growth for mature individuals and a positive allometric growth for immature lionfishes. These results suggest a different allocation of resources, most likely reproduction for mature individuals and somatic growth for the immature lionfish. The relative condition factor (KN) was similar for immature and mature individuals. Genetic analyses indicated that P. volitans is the only lionfish species present in Puerto Rico, and that its origin was likely dispersal from the epicenter of introduction off the coast of Florida. Interestingly, only four of the nine mtDNA haplotypes identified in the Atlantic were observed in the Puerto Rican population. A fine-scale population genetic analysis suggested a significantly different population structure between the west and south coasts. Finally, our data suggests a second founder effect, but with a reduction of haplotype diversity. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).},

To resolve the complexity, firstly, thorough kinematic and dynamic analysis on the whole UVM system is performed. Then, the whole dynamics is divided into several meaningful terms. A robust coordinated motion control algorithm for autonomous UVM systems is considered next based on the analysis of divided dynamics. Since the vehicle has relatively smaller bandwidth than manipulators, active damping control with two-time scale approach for the manipulator is proposed. Using this algorithm, the manipulator controller can cover the vehicle state. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by computer simulations.},

They have more flexible bodies and therefore, can deal with complex environment. Nevertheless, some other issues make the locomotion control of legged robots a much complicated task, such as the redundant degree of freedoms and balance keeping. From literatures, locomotion control has been solved mainly based on programming mechanism. To use this method, walking trajectories for each leg and the gaits have to be designed, and the adaptability to an unknown environment cannot be guaranteed. From another aspect, studying and simulating animals' walking mechanism for engineering application is an efficient way to break the bottleneck of locomotion control for legged robots. This has attracted more and more attentions. Inspired by central pattern generator (CPG), a control method has been proved to be a successful attempt within this scope. In this paper, we will review the biological mechanism, the existence evidences, and the network properties of CPG. From the engineering perspective, we will introduce the engineering simulation of CPG, the property analysis, and the research progress of CPG inspired control method in locomotion control of legged robots.

abstract = {Nonlinear oscillators are widely used in biology, physics and engineering for modeling and control. They are interesting because of their synchronization properties when coupled to other dynamical systems. In this paper, we propose a learning rule for oscillators which adapts their frequency to the frequency of any periodic or pseudo-periodic input signal. Learning is done in a dynamic way: it is part of the dynamical system and not an offline process. An interesting property of our model is that it is easily generalizable to a large class of oscillators, from phase oscillators to relaxation oscillators and strange attractors with a generic learning rule. One major feature of our learning rule is that the oscillators constructed can adapt their frequency without any signal processing or the need to specify a time window or similar free parameters. All the processing is embedded in the dynamics of the adaptive oscillator. The convergence of the learning is proved for the Hopf oscillator, then numerical experiments are carried out to explore the learning capabilities of the system. Finally, we generalize the learning rule to non-harmonic oscillators like relaxation oscillators and strange attractors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Topographic structural complexity of a reef is highly correlated to coral growth rates, coral cover and overall levels of biodiversity, and is therefore integral in determining ecological processes. Modeling these processes commonly includes measures of rugosity obtained from a wide range of different survey techniques that often fail to capture rugosity at different spatial scales. Here we show that accurate estimates of rugosity can be obtained from video footage captured using underwater video cameras (i.e., monocular video). To demonstrate the accuracy of our method, we compared the results to in situ measurements of a 2m x 20m area of forereef from Glovers Reef atoll in Belize. Sequential pairs of images were used to compute fine scale bathymetric reconstructions of the reef substrate from which precise measurements of rugosity and reef topographic structural complexity can be derived across multiple spatial scales. To achieve accurate bathymetric reconstructions from uncalibrated monocular video, the position of the camera for each image in the video sequence and the intrinsic parameters (e.g., focal length) must be computed simultaneously. We show that these parameters can be often determined when the data exhibits parallax-type motion, and that rugosity and reef complexity can be accurately computed from existing video sequences taken from any type of underwater camera from any reef habitat or location. This technique provides an infinite array of possibilities for future coral reef research by providing a cost-effective and automated method of determining structural complexity and rugosity in both new and historical video surveys of coral reefs.},

abstract = {Most current navigation algorithms in mobile robotics produce 2D maps from data provided by 2D sensors. In large part this is due to the availability of suitable 3D sensors and difficulties of managing the large amount of data supplied by 3D sensors. This paper presents a novel, multi-resolution algorithm that aligns 3D range data stored in occupied voxel lists so as to facilitate the construction of 3D maps. Multi-resolution occupied voxel lists (MROL) are voxel based data structures that efficiently represent 3D scan and map information. The process described in this research can align a sequence of scans to produce maps and localise a range sensor within a prior global map. An office environment (200 square metres) is mapped in 3D at 0.02 m resolution, resulting in a 200,000 voxel occupied voxel list. Global localisation within this map, with no prior pose estimate, is completed in 5 seconds on a 2 GHz processor. The MROL based sequential scan matching is compared to a standard iterative closest point (ICP) implementation with an error in the initial pose estimate of plus or minus 1 m and 90 degrees. MROL correctly scan matches 94{\%} of scans to within 0.1 m as opposed to ICP with 30{\%} within 0.1 m.},

This, in combination with the limited camera-to-light separation available on most imaging platforms, places severe limitations on our ability to optically image large areas of the sea floor at high resolution. In this paper, we present a general framework for mosaicking large areas underwater with a specific emphasis on the issues that are unique to the underwater environment. At the individual image level, we examine the role of attenuation, scattering, and camera to light separation and present the tradeoffs involved in optimizing a particular imaging geometry. We also examine the arbitrary image-registration problem in the face of conditions prevalent underwater, namely a moving nonuniform lighting source and the effects of a featureless unstructured terrain. Our analysis is based on photomosaics encompassing several hundred images on archaeological, forensic, and geological expeditions from a diverse set of imaging platforms, including the NR-1 nuclear submarine, the manned submersible Alvin, the Argo towed vehicle, the Jason remotely operated vehicle, and the ABE autonomous underwater vehicle.},

In contrast to the conventional approach, the method does not make use of the collinearity condition. Instead, the algebraic structure of the problem is fully exploited in arriving at a solution which is independent of the configuration of the feature points. Although the method is applicable to any number or distribution of feature points, no more than five points are needed from a numerical standpoint; three or four points will typically suffice. A necessary condition for the existence of the solution is obtained for the first time, and a rigorous proof of uniqueness is presented for the case of four coplanar points. Simulation results have shown that, in the case of four feature points, nonplanar configurations generally outperform coplanar point sets in both accuracy and robustness in the presence of image noise},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {Landscape video mosaics (Lirman et al. 2007) were acquired at four sites in the Hind Bank Marine Conservation District,USVirgin Islands (Smith et al. in press), one of which is shown here. This mosaic covers 31 m2 with a resolution of 1.8 mm/pixel. Live stony coral cover, estimated from 400 random points on the mosaic, was high (42.5{\%}). The community was dominated by plating or encrusting forms of colonies of the genus Montastraea. Other coral genera identified from the video at lower abundance included Agaricia, Colpophyllia, Helioseris, Mycetophyllia, and Porites. Dive time and diver training were not obstacles to video acquisition for landscape mosaics, which in this case took only 25 min per mosaic by a diver who had only one practice acquisition. Processing each mosaic took about 1 h of analyst time and 24 h of computer time. The ease of data acquisition, ability to use off-the-shelf hardware (i.e., a video camera and possibly lights), and potential suite of indicators (e.g., benthic cover, coral sizes, disease prevalence, and bleaching) that can be obtained from the images suggest that landscape mosaics could be applied widely for surveys of mesophotic coral ecosystems.},

First, we train a network where each input of the data can only have one of the two possible values, -1 or one. Next, we apply the hyperbolic tangent function to each connection from the input layer to the hidden layer of the network. By applying this squashing function, the activation values at the hidden units are effectively computed as the hyperbolic tangent (or the sigmoid) of the weighted inputs, where the weights have magnitudes that are equal one. By restricting the inputs and the weights to binary values either -1 or one, the extraction of M-of-N rules from the networks becomes trivial. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on several widely tested datasets. For datasets consisting of thousands of patterns with many attributes, the rules extracted by the algorithm are simple and accurate.},

Among many, automatic vision-guided station keeping, localization and navigation, photo-mosaicking and 3D mapping comprise application areas of special interest. The core issue in realizing these capabilities is to know with high accuracy the motion and (or) position of the vehicle. Over the last decade, a small, but growing, group of research centers have committed an extensive effort in underwater vision activities. Methods based on various approaches in motion vision- e.g., correlation-based, feature-based, optical flow-based, or direct are being developed and implemented in support of different applications on specialized platforms that may simultaneously utilize other sensors for positioning. This makes it somewhat difficult, for user groups unfamiliar with the methodologies or technologies, to evaluate the capabilities of these vision systems. The main motivation for this work was to carry out and report the results of experiments with various techniques for positioning and mosaicking, on the same data set},

We show that for the task of indoor exploration the visual information is highly redundant, allowing successful navigation even using only a small fraction of the available data. The method keeps the robot centered in the corridor by estimating two state parameters: the orientation within the corridor, and the distance to the end of the corridor. The orientation is determined by combining the results of five complementary measures, while the estimated distance to the end combines the results of three complementary measures. These measures, which are predominantly information-theoretic, are analyzed independently, and the combined system is tested in several un-known corridor buildings exhibiting a wide variety of ap- pearances, showing the sufficiency of low-resolution visual information for mobile robot exploration. Because the algorithm discards such a large percentage of the pixels both spatially and temporally, processing occurs at an average of 1000 frames per second, thus freeing the processor for other concurrent tasks.},

abstract = {The relationship between the three-dimensional coordinates of a point and the corresponding two-dimensional coordinates of its image, as seen by a camera, can be expressed in terms of a 3 by 4 matrix using the homogeneous coordinate system. This matrix is known more generally as the transformation matrix and it is well known that such a matrix can be determined experimentally by measuring the image coordinates of six or more points in space, whose three-dimensional coordinates are known. Such a transformation matrix can be derived analytically from knowledge of the camera position, orientation, focal length and scaling and translation parameters in the image plane. However, the inverse problem of computing the camera location and orientation from the transformation matrix involves solution of simultaneous nonlinear equations in several variables and is considered difficult. In this paper we present a new and simple analytical technique that accomplishes this inversion rather easily. This technique is quite powerful and has applications to a wide variety of problems in Computer Vision for both static and dynamic scenes. The technique has been implemented as a C program running under Unix and works well on real data. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {In this paper the flocking problem for a multi-robot system, consisting in making the robots of a team grouping together, is addressed. The flocking is achieved resorting to the Null-Space-based Behavioral (NSB) control by defining very simple behaviors for each robot of the team and by properly arranging these behaviors in priority. The NSB algorithm, making the robots using only local information, successfully achieves the flocking with or without a rendez-vous point and in eventual presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations and experiments using differential-drive mobile robots prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Steatornis caripensis (the oilbird) is a very unusual bird. It supposedly never sees daylight, roosting in huge aggregations in caves during the day and bringing back fruit to the cave at night. As a consequence a large number of the seeds from the fruit they feed upon germinate in the cave and spoil. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here we use newly developed GPS/acceleration loggers with remote UHF readout to show that several assumptions about the behaviour of Steatornis caripensis need to be revised. On average, they spend only every 3(rd) day in a cave, individuals spent most days sitting quietly in trees in the rainforest where they regurgitate seeds. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This provides new data on the extent of seed dispersal and the movement ecology of Steatornis caripensis. It suggests that Steatornis caripensis is perhaps the most important long-distance seed disperser in Neotropical forests. We also show that colony-living comes with high activity costs to individuals.},

abstract = {Online trajectory generation for robots with multiple degrees of freedom is still a difficult and unsolved problem, in particular for non-steady state locomotion, that is, when the robot has to move in a complex environment with continuous variations of the speed, direction, and type of locomotor behavior. In this article we address the problem of controlling the non-steady state swimming and crawling of a novel fish robot. For this, we have designed a control architecture based on a central pattern generator (CPG) implemented as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators. The CPG, like its biological counterpart, can produce coordinated patterns of rhythmic activity while being modulated by simple control parameters. To test our controller, we designed BoxyBot, a simple fish robot with three actuated fins capable of swimming in water and crawling on firm ground. Using the CPG model, the robot is capable of performing and switching between a variety of different locomotor behaviors such as swimming forwards, swimming backwards, turning, rolling, moving upwards/downwards, and crawling. These behaviors are triggered and modulated by sensory input provided by light, water, and touch sensors. Results are presented demonstrating the agility of the robot and interesting properties of a CPG-based control approach such as stability of the rhythmic patterns due to limit cycle behavior, and the production of smooth trajectories despite abrupt changes of control parameters. The robot is currently used in a temporary 20-month long exhibition at the EPFL. We present the hardware setup that was designed for the exhibition, and the type of interactions with the control system that allow visitors to influence the behavior of the robot. The exhibition is useful to test the robustness of the robot for long term use, and to demonstrate the suitability of the CPG-based approach for interactive control with a human in the loop. This article is an extended version of an article presented at BioRob2006 the first IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics.},

abstract = {The inquisitive nature of humans has lead to the comprehensive exploration and mapping of land masses on planet earth, subsequently scientists are now turning to the oceans to discover new possibilities for telecommunications, biological {\&} geological resources and energy sources. Underwater vehicles play an important role in this exploration as the deep ocean is a harsh and unforgiving environment for human discovery. Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) are utilised for many different scientific, military and commercial applications such as high resolution seabed surveying (Yoerger et al. 2000), mine countermeasures (Freitag et al. 2005), inspection and repair of underwater man-made structures (Kondo {\&} Ura 2004) and wreck discovery and localisation (Eustice et al. 2005). Accurate vehicle position knowledge is vital for all underwater missions for correct registration between sensor and navigation data and also for control and final recovery of the vehicle. The characteristics of the underwater environment pose a plethora of difficult challenges for vehicle navigation and these obstacles differ greatly from the issues encountered in land, air and space based navigation (Whitcomb 2000). The rapid attenuation of acoustic and electromagnetic radiation in water restricts the range of acoustic and optical sensors and also limits communication bandwidth. As a consequence of this severe absorption acoustic and optical sensors require submersion near to the survey mission site to gather accurate high resolution data sets. The limitation on communication bandwidth means that vehicle autonomy can only be achieved when the large majority of computation is performed onboard. Whereas land based vehicles can rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) for accurate 3D position updates, the underwater equivalent acoustic transponder network is limited by range, accuracy, the associated cost and deployment {\&} calibration time.},

The biped robot is under- actuated with six degrees of under-actuation during flight. The trajectory generation strategies for the hip and both legs in a flight phase use the approximated running model and non-holonomic constraints based on the linear and angular momenta at the mass center. Next, we present an impedance control with a force modulation strategy to guarantee a sta- ble landing on the ground and simultaneously track the de- sired trajectories where the desired impedance at the hip link and both legs is specified.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a real-time vision-based localization approach for humanoid robots using a single camera as the only sensor. In order to obtain an accurate localization of the robot, we first build an accurate 3D map of the environment. In the map computation process, we use stereo visual SLAM techniques based on non-linear least squares optimization methods (bundle adjustment). Once we have computed a 3D reconstruction of the environment, which comprises of a set of camera poses (keyframes) and a list of 3D points, we learn the visibility of the 3D points by exploiting all the geometric relationships between the camera poses and 3D map points involved in the reconstruction. Finally, we use the prior 3D map and the learned visibility prediction for monocular vision-based localization. Our algorithm is very efficient, easy to implement and more robust and accurate than existing approaches. By means of visibility prediction we predict for a query pose only the highly visible 3D points, thus, speeding up tremendously the data association between 3D map points and perceived 2D features in the image. In this way, we can solve very efficiently the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem providing robust and fast vision-based localization. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach by showing several vision-based localization experiments with the HRP-2 humanoid robot.},

abstract = {The recent decline in the condition of coral reef communities worldwide has fueled the need to develop innovative assessment tools to document coral abundance and distribution rapidly and effectively. While most monitoring programs rely primarily on data collected in situ by trained divers, digital photographs and video are used increasingly to extract ecological indicators, provide a permanent visual record of reef condition, and reduce the time that divers spend underwater. In this study, we describe the development and application of a video-based reef survey methodology based on an algorithm for image registration and the estimation of image motion and camera trajectory. This technology was used to construct two-dimensional, spatially accurate, high-resolution mosaics of the reef benthos at a scale of up to 400 m(2). The mosaics were analyzed to estimate the size and percent cover of reef organisms and these ecological indicators of reef condition were compared to similar measurements collected by divers to evaluate the potential of the mosaics as monitoring tools. The ecological indicators collected by trained divers compared favorably with those measured directly from the video mosaics. Five out of the eight categories chosen (hard corals, octocorals, Palythoa, algal turf, and sand) showed no significant differences in percent cover based on survey method. Moreover, no significant differences based on survey method were found in the size of coral colonies. Lastly, the capability to extract the same reef location from mosaics collected at different times proved to be an important tool for documenting change in coral abundance as the removal of even small colonies ({\textless}10 cm in diameter) was easily documented. The two-dimensional video mosaics constructed in this study can provide repeatable, accurate measurements on the reef-plot scale that can complement measurements on the colony-scale made by divers and surveys conducted at regional scales using remote sensing tools.},

abstract = {Understanding how individuals within a population of invasive organisms disperse during various life history stages has obvious implications for long term population dynamics in the invaded range. With the rapid expansion of the invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) in the western Atlantic and Caribbean, it has become increasingly important to understand how individuals move following initial recruitment, as this may have critical implications for population control and management. We conducted a 10-month mark-recapture study in the lower Loxahatchee River estuary (Florida, USA) to identify movement patterns and site fidelity in juvenile and young adult lionfish. We tagged 55 lionfish, ranging in size from 45 to 185. mm standard length (66-256. mm total length). Eighty percent of the tagged fish were recaptured at least one time during the course of the study. Lionfish in this system exhibited extremely high site fidelity over extended periods of time and across multiple size classes. Maximum range occupied by individuals along the shoreline of the estuary was small (mean=28m, asymmetrical 95{\%} CI: 10 to 51. m), and did not vary with lionfish size. The majority of lionfish recaptures (74{\%}) occurred at or near (0-10. m) the previous capture site, even after weeks or months at liberty. In systems where lionfish exhibit extremely high site fidelity and small maximum ranges, localized population control may be feasible, since lionfish removed from a given habitat would be replaced largely through larval recruitment rather than migration of older individuals. However, since lionfish grow extremely rapidly (averaging 0.46. mm/day, but reaching as high as 0.78. mm/day in one individual), localized control efforts would need to be carried out frequently in order to maintain a younger, smaller population. Localized control may be less effective if lionfish exhibit greater movement and lower site fidelity in other invaded systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

It is proposed here that this kind of adaptation can be modeled as a distributed system of adaptive modules (AMs) acting on a distributed system of adaptive oscillators called Adaptive Ring Rules (ARRs), augmented with appropriate and simple reflexes. It is shown that such a system can self-program through interaction with the environment. The adaptation emerges spontaneously as several discrete stages: Body twisting, short quick steps, and finally longer, coordinated stepping. This approach is demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot. The result is that the system can learn to walk several minutes after inception.},

abstract = {Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth's ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of 'blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.},

abstract = {Can one develop an abstract description of the dynamics of pattern generators that provides quantitative insight into their operation? We explored this question by examining the dynamics of a model central pattern generator that was created using an evolutionary algorithm. We propose an abstract description based on the concept of a dynamical module, a set of neurons that simultaneously make their transitions from one quasistable state to another while the synaptic inputs that they receive from other neurons remain essentially constant, thus temporarily reducing the dimensionality of the circuit dynamics. Using the mathematical tools of dynamical systems theory, we describe a method for identifying dynamical modules and demonstrate that this concept can be used to quantitatively characterize constraints on neural architecture, account for phase durations, and predict the effects of parameter changes. Moreover, this abstract description reveals coordinated parameter changes that leave the overall circuit dynamics essentially unchanged. In a companion article we employ this abstract description to examine the relationship between general principles and individual variability in large populations of evolved model pattern generators.},

abstract = {Designing efficient methods for training dynamic neural networks for learning spatio-temporal patterns is of great interest at present. In particular, the “trajectory generation problem” that involves training the network to learn and replicate autonomously a specified time-varying periodic motion has attracted considerable recent attention. A novel systematic approach to solve this problem by decomposing the overall task into two sub-tasks, a spatio-temporal sequence assignment and a mapping of ordered sequences, is presented in this paper. This decomposition permits the dynamic neural network to be realized as a cascade of a simple recurrent net followed by a non-recurrent one that yields considerable reduction in training complexity. A detailed performance evaluation of the present scheme is given by considering several trajectory generation experiments that highlight the strong points of this approach, which include simplicity and accuracy in training, flexibility to include control parameters in order to modify on-line the shape of the trajectory learned and the speed of repetition along a cyclic trajectory, and the possibility of learning both continuous and discontinuous trajectory patterns.},

abstract = {Large area mapping at high resolution underwater continues to be constrained by sensor-level environmental constraints and the mismatch between available navigation and sensor accuracy. In this paper, advances are presented that exploit aspects of the sensing modality, and consistency and redundancy within local sensor measurements to build high-resolution optical and acoustic maps that are a consistent representation of the environment. This work is presented in the context of real-world data acquired using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) working in diverse applications including shallow water coral reef surveys with the Seabed AUV, a forensic survey of the RMS Titanic in the North Atlantic at a depth of 4100 m using the Hercules ROV, and a survey of the TAG hydrothermal vent area in the mid-Atlantic at a depth of 3600 m using the Jason II ROV. Specifically, the focus is on the related problems of structure from motion from underwater optical imagery assuming pose instrumented calibrated cameras. General wide baseline solutions are presented for these problems based on the extension of techniques from the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), photogrammetric and the computer vision communities. It is also examined how such techniques can be extended for the very different sensing modality and scale associated with multi-beam bathymetric mapping. For both the optical and acoustic mapping cases it is also shown how the consistency in mapping can be used not only for better global mapping, but also to refine navigation estimates.},

In spite of the progress achieved in the last years in control of walking robots, many problems are yet to be resolved. The inherent complexity of such robots makes their control a difficult task even on the modern hardware. In order to address this issue ap- proximate models and high performance algorithms are employed. This thesis is focused on the model predictive control of a walking bipedal robot, which is approximated by an inverted pendulum, using online optimization. A special emphasis is made on the solvers that exploit the structure of quadratic opti- mization problems in the context of model predictive control. Two methods for solution of these problems are implemented: primal active set and primal loga- rithmic barrier methods. They are tested and compared in a simulation and on a humanoid robot. A software module for control of the Nao humanoid robot is developed for this purpose. i},

abstract = {An extreme example of a low light-level lifestyle among flying birds is provided by the oilbird, Steatornis caripensis (Steatornithidae, Caprimulgiformes). Oilbirds breed and roost in caves, often at sufficient depth that no daylight can penetrate, and forage for fruits at night. Using standard microscopy techniques we investigated the retinal structure of oilbird eyes and used an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique to determine the parameters of these birds' visual fields. The retina is dominated by small rod receptors (diameter 1.3+/-0.2 microm; length 18.6+/-0.6 microm) arranged in a banked structure that is unique among terrestrial vertebrates. This arrangement achieves a photoreceptor density that is the highest so far recorded (approximately 1,000,000 rods mm(-2)) in any vertebrate eye. Cone photoreceptors are, however, present in low numbers. The eye is relatively small (axial length 16.1+/-0.2 mm) with a maximum pupil diameter of 9.0+/-0.0 mm, achieving a light-gathering capacity that is the highest recorded in a bird (f-number approximately 1.07). The binocular field has a maximum width of 38 degrees and extends vertically through 100 degrees with the bill projecting towards the lower periphery; a topography that suggests that vision is not used to control bill position. We propose that oilbird eyes are at one end of the continuum that juxtaposes the conflicting fundamental visual capacities of sensitivity and resolution. Thus, while oilbird visual sensitivity may be close to a maximum, visual resolution must be low. This explains why these birds employ other sensory cues, including olfaction and echolocation, in the control of their behaviour in low-light-level environments.},

In practice, there are many applications of camera pose tracking from planar targets and there is also a number of recent pose estimation algorithms which perform this task in real-time, but all of these algorithms suffer from pose ambiguities. This paper investigates the pose ambiguity for planar targets viewed by a perspective camera. We show that pose ambiguities--two distinct local minima of the according error function--exist even for cases with wide angle lenses and close range targets. We give a comprehensive interpretation of the two minima and derive an analytical solution that locates the second minimum. Based on this solution, we develop a new algorithm for unique and robust pose estimation from a planar target. In the experimental evaluation, this algorithm outperforms four state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithms.},

abstract = {Are there general principles for pattern generation? We examined this question by analyzing the operation of large populations of evolved model central pattern generators (CPGs) for walking. Three populations of model CPGs were evolved, containing three, four, or five neurons. We identified six general principles. First, locomotion performance increased with the number of interneurons. Second, the top 10 three-, four-, and five-neuron CPGs could be decomposed into dynamical modules, an abstract description developed in a companion article. Third, these dynamical modules were multistable: they could be switched between multiple stable output configurations. Fourth, the rhythmic pattern generated by a CPG could be understood as a closed chain of successive destabilizations of one dynamical module by another. A combinatorial analysis enumerated the possible dynamical modular structures. Fifth, one-dimensional modules were frequently observed and, in some cases, could be assigned specific functional roles. Finally, dynamic dynamical modules, in which the modular structure itself changed over one cycle, were frequently observed. The existence of these general principles despite significant variability in both patterns of connectivity and neural parameters was explained by degeneracy in the maps from neural parameters to neural dynamics to behavior to fitness. An analysis of the biomechanical properties of the model body was essential for relating neural activity to behavior. Our studies of evolved model circuits suggest that, in the absence of other constraints, there is no compelling reason to expect neural circuits to be functionally decomposable as the number of interneurons increase. Analyzing idealized model pattern generators may be an effective methodology for gaining insights into the operation of biological pattern generators.},

abstract = {Abstract: Endemism is thought to be relatively rare in marine systems due to the lack of allopatric barriers and the potential for long-distance colonization via pelagic larval dispersal. Although many species of coral reef fishes exhibit regionally restricted color variants that are suggestive of regional endemism, such variation is typically ascribed to intraspecific variation. We examined the genetic structure in 5 putatively monospecific fishes from the Indo-West Pacific (Amphiprion melanopus, Chrysiptera talboti, and Pomacentrus moluccensis [Pomacentridae] and Cirrhilabrus punctatus, and Labroides dimidiatus [Labridae]) that express regional color variation unique to this area. Mitochondrial-control-region sequence analysis showed shallow to deep genetic divergence in all 5 species (sequence divergence 2–17{\%}), with clades concordant with regional color variation. These results were partially supported by nuclear RAG2 data. An analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) mirrored the phylogenetic results; $\Phi$ST values ranged from 0.91 to 0.7, indicating high levels of geographic partitioning of genetic variation. Concordance of genetics and phenotype demonstrate the genetic uniqueness of southwestern Pacific color variants, indicating that these populations are at a minimum distinct evolutionarily significant units and perhaps distinct regionally endemic species. Our results indicate that the alpha biodiversity of the southwestern Pacific is likely underestimated even in well-studied groups, such as reef fishes, and that regional endemism may be more common in tropical marine systems than previously thought.},

abstract = {While the study of geometry has mainly concentrated on single viewpoint (SVP) cameras, there is growing attention to more general non-SVP systems. Here, we study an important class of systems that inherently have a non-SVP: a perspective camera imaging through an interface into a medium. Such systems are ubiquitous: They are common when looking into water-based environments. The paper analyzes the common flat-interface class of systems. It characterizes the locus of the viewpoints (caustic) of this class and proves that the SVP model is invalid in it. This may explain geometrical errors encountered in prior studies. Our physics-based model is parameterized by the distance of the lens from the medium interface, besides the focal length. The physical parameters are calibrated by a simple approach that can be based on a single frame. This directly determines the system geometry. The calibration is then used to compensate for modeled system distortion. Based on this model, geometrical measurements of objects are significantly more accurate than if based on an SVP model. This is demonstrated in real-world experiments. In addition, we examine by simulation the errors expected by using the SVP model. We show that when working at a constant range, the SVP model can be a good approximation.},

abstract = {Periodic behavior is key to life and is observed in multiple instances and at multiple time scales in our metabolism, our natural environment, and our engineered environment. A natural way of modeling or generating periodic behavior is done by using oscillators, i.e., dynamical systems that exhibit limit cycle behavior. While there is extensive literature on methods to analyze such dynamical systems, much less work has been done on methods to synthesize an oscillator to exhibit some specific desired characteristics. The goal of this article is twofold: (1) to provide a framework for characterizing and designing oscillators and (2) to review how classes of well-known oscillators can be understood and related to this framework. The basis of the framework is to characterize oscillators in terms of their fundamental temporal and spatial behavior and in terms of properties that these two behaviors can be designed to exhibit. This focus on fundamental properties is important because it allows us to systematically compare a large variety of oscillators that might at first sight appear very different from each other. We identify several specifications that are useful for design, such as frequency-locking behavior, phase-locking behavior, and specific output signal shape. We also identify two classes of design methods by which these specifications can be met, namely offline methods and online methods. By relating these specifications to our framework and by presenting several examples of how oscillators have been designed in the literature, this article provides a useful methodology and toolbox for designing oscillators for a wide range of purposes. In particular, the focus on synthesis of limit cycle dynamical systems should be useful both for engineering and for computational modeling of physical or biological phenomena.},

abstract = {Abstract Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus is an anadromous clupeid fish of long-standing ecological and socioeconomic importance along the Atlantic coast of North America. Since the 1970s, Alewife populations have been declining throughout the species? range. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the decline, but a lack of basic information on population demographics inhibits hypothesis testing. In this study, we evaluated the use of morphometric analysis to discriminate among spawning stocks of Alewives collected from 24 sites in Maine and one site in Massachusetts. We first identified 10 morphometric measurements that were not influenced by the freezing?thawing process, and then used principal component and discriminant function analyses to develop stock-structure classification models from these 10 measurements. Classification models were able to discriminate Alewives to be from Maine or the single Massachusetts site 100{\%} of the time. In addition, classification models correctly classified pooled sampling sites from the extreme western and eastern parts of Maine with 64{\%} accuracy. Morphometric analysis may therefore provide an easily accessible, comparatively fast, and inexpensive method to discriminate marine-captured Alewives spawned in areas separated by major biogeographic regions, large geographic distances (100s of kilometers), or both, and thus help inform questions about stock composition at these spatial scales for assessment surveys and bycatch events.

abstract = {The inherent properties of water column usually affect underwater imagery by suppressing high-energy wavelengths. One of the inherent properties, diffuse attenuation, can be estimated from multi or hyper spectral data and thus give information on how fast light of different wavelengths decreases with increasing depth. Based on exact depth measurements and data from a spectrometer incoming light on an object can be calculated and diffuse attenuation coefficient can be estimated. In this work the authors introduce a mathematical model that suggests the most stable wavelengths, which corresponds to estimated coefficients, based on spectral information from each depth. These values are then used in reconstruction of colours in underwater imagery. Since there are no digital hyper spectral cameras yet we are for the time being confined to point data, but the method is general and we show how it can be applied on multi spectral images.},

First, we explore the applications of the unified theory for central catadioptric cameras for attitude and heading estimation, explaining how the skyline is projected on the catadioptric image and how it is segmented and used to calculate the UAV's attitude. Then we use appearance images to obtain a visual compass, and we calculate the relative rotation and heading of the aerial vehicle. Additionally, we show the use of a stereo system to calculate the aircraft height and to measure the UAV's motion. Finally, we present a visual tracking system based on Fuzzy controllers working in both a UAV and a camera pan and tilt platform. Every part is tested using the UAV COLIBRI platform to validate the different approaches, which include comparison of the estimated data with the inertial values measured onboard the helicopter platform and the validation of the tracking schemes on real flights.},

Habitats were also mapped using the high-resolution digital airborne sensor, CASI (compact airborne spectrographic imager). To map areas {\textgreater}60 km in any direction with coarse detail, Landsat TM was the most accurate and cost-effective satellite sensor (SPOT XS when {\textless}60 km). For maps with intermediate habitat detail, aerial photography (from a comparable study in Anguilla) exhibited similar accuracy to Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Landsat MSS was consistently the least accurate sensor. Maps from CASI were significantly (p{\textless}0.001) more accurate than satellite sensors and aerial photographs. Maps with detailed habitat information (i.e. {\textgreater}9 reef classes) had a maximum accuracy of 37{\%} when based on satellite imagery, but aerial photography and CASI achieved accuracies of 67 and 81{\%}, respectively. Commissioning of new aerial photography does not appear to be a cost-effective option; satellites are cheaper for coarse habitat-mapping, and detailed habitat-mapping can be conducted more accurately and cheaply with CASI. The results will guide practitioners in matching survey objectives to appropriate remote-sensing methods.},

abstract = {The application of optical flow techniques on artificial image sequences in computing relative motions of obstacles is studied as a data processing algorithm for ultrasonic sensors. These sensors in robot systems are widely used in calculating the distance of obstacles. However, owing to the angular uncertainty of sensor characteristics, limitations exist on the positioning of an object's location, making it difficult to obtain accurate velocity information. Collision avoidance in dynamic environments requires information on relative motion, such as distance and velocity. In this paper, a technique for image processing on a range of ultrasonic sensor data is suggested in order to obtain the relative motion of front objects. The proposed technique is conducted using a two-wheel differential drive robot for problem cases related to indoor navigation. Digital filtering is also conducted to smooth the fluctuations, after which relative velocity is calculated using the optical flow technique. Experimental results demonstrate the possible application of the proposed algorithm for robot navigation in dynamic environments. This technique will increase the intelligence of robot systems, allowing for effective sensing in various environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} Authors 2011.},

The motion control is based on the Central Pattern Generator (CPG), and is optimized by Simulated Annealing. Optimization of parameters in the motion control based on the CPG is a very hard problem. The number of the parameters which should be optimized increases as a robot's link structure becomes complicated. To optimize all parameters simultaneously may cause explosion of search space. Therefore, we divide search space into upper-limbs optimization space and leg optimization space. We then propose a parallel optimization method by two processes, which handles the control parameters of upper-limbs and legs, and communicates them each other. In the experiments, our method succeeded in optimization of all parameters without explosion of search space, and performed superior gaits.},

The mission goal is defined in terms of accuracy in the reconstruction of the environmental field to be sampled. Adaptive cooperative behaviour is achieved by each vehicle in terms of locally evaluating the smoothness of the sampled field, and selecting the next sampling point in order to achieve the desired accuracy; smoothness evaluation and accuracy estimation have been proposed either in terms of analytical formulation related to field estimation with RBFs, or in terms of empirically derived fuzzy-like rules. Simulative results show that the vehicles team does behave as expected, increasing the spatial sampling rate as an increase in the environmental variability is detected. The number of samples required by both algorithms is sensibly inferior to those needed by sampling the area at equally spaced locations, as in the case of off-line, non-adaptive planners.},

The proposed method can be configured to the characteristics (e.g., the size of the dataset, number of classes, resolution of the samples, color information availability, class types, etc.) of individual datasets. The proposed method uses completed local binary pattern (CLBP), grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Gabor filter response, and opponent angle and hue channel color histograms as feature descriptors. For classification, either k- nearest neighbor (KNN), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM) or probability density weighted mean distance (PDWMD) is used. The combination of features and classifiers that attains the best results is presented together with the guidelines for selection. The accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method are compared with other state-of-the-art techniques using three benthic and three texture datasets. The proposed method achieves the highest overall classification accuracy of any of the tested methods and has moderate execution time. Finally, the proposed classification scheme is applied to a large-scale image mosaic of the Red Sea to create a completely classified thematic map of the reef benthos.},

It is argued that lack of such social-ecological fit makes governance and conservation difficult, yet progress in explicitly defining and rigorously testing what constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences. Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a systems level while also providing information on how individual actors are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole social-ecological system was positively affected. When the scales at which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors' positions in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit. Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of actors' varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.

abstract = {The solution to the simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem where an autonomous vehicle starts in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then incrementally build a map of landmarks present in this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location is now well understood. Although a number of SLAM implementations have appeared in the recent literature, the need to maintain the knowledge of the relative relationships between all the landmark location estimates contained in the map makes SLAM computationally intractable in implementations containing more than a few tens of landmarks. This paper presents the theoretical basis and a practical implementation of a feature selection strategy that significantly reduces the computation requirements for SLAM. The paper shows that it is indeed possible to remove a large percentage of the landmarks from the map without making the map building process statistically inconsistent. Furthermore, it is shown that the computational cost of the SLAM algorithm can be reduced by judicious selection of landmarks to be preserved in the map.},

Then, for the adaptive attitude control method during the 2-leg supporting phase, we consider four methods, that is, a) rotation of body along the diagonal line between supporting feet, b) translation of body along the perpendicular line between supporting feet, c) vertical swing motion of recovering legs, and d) horizontal swing motion of recovering legs; we then describe how we verify the stabilization efficiency of each method through computer simulation, stabilization experimentation, and experimenting in walking on rough terrain using the quadruped walking robot, TITAN-VIII.},

abstract = {Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMO) are often criticized for ineffectual management of high-seas fisheries resources. However, in the case of the two Atlantic swordfish stocks occurring in the North and South Atlantic, those stocks have rebuilt to the BMSY objective of the responsible RFMO, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The relative contribution of the management actions of the RFMO and biological characteristics of swordfish stocks are evaluated in relation to the recovery of the stocks. It is concluded that while swordfish have characteristics that promote stock resilience (including relatively fast growth, and spatially- and temporally-dispersed spawning), positive management actions combined with a period of relatively good recruitmentwere essential to achieve the rebuilt outcome. The challenges that the RFMO faces to maintain the stocks in the rebuilt condition are described, and some possible additional measures discussed.},

abstract = {The main objective of an Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV) is to provide an operator with services from its payload. Currently, to get these UAV services, one extra human operator is required to navigate the UAV. Many techniques have been investigated to increase UAV navigation autonomy at the Path Planning level. The most challenging aspect of this task is the re-planning requirement, which comes from the fact that UAVs are called upon to fly in unknown environments. One technique that out performs the others in path planning is the Genetic Algorithm (GA) method because of its capacity to explore the solution space while preserving the best solutions already found. However, because the GA tends to be slow due to its iterative process that involves many candidate solutions, the approach has not been actively pursued for real time systems. This paper presents the research that we have done to improve the GA computation time in order to obtain a path planning generator that can recompile a path in real-time, as unforeseen events are met by the UAV. The paper details how we achieved parallelism with a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the GA. Our FPGA implementation not only results in an excellent autonomous path planner, but it also provides the design foundations of a hardware chip that could be added to an UAV platform.},

First, we present our adaptive frequency Hopf oscillator, and illustrate how it can learn the frequencies of complex rhythmic input signals. Then, we present a controller based on these adaptive oscillators applied to the control of a simulated 4-degrees-of-freedom spring-mass hopper. By the appropriate design of the couplings between the adaptive oscillators and the mechanical system, the controller adapts to the mechanical properties of the hopper, in particular its resonant frequency. As a result, hopping is initiated and locomotion similar to the bound emerges. Interestingly, efficient locomotion is achieved without explicit inter-limb coupling, i.e. the only effective inter-limb coupling is established via the mechanical system and the environment. Furthermore, the self-organization process leads to forward locomotion which is optimal with respect to the velocity/power ratio. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

A bot controls a number of units that will have to navigate in a partially unknown environment, while at the same time avoid each other, search for enemies, and coordinate attacks to fight them down. Potential fields are a technique originating from the area of robotics where it is used in controlling the navigation of robots in dynamic environments. Although attempts have been made to transfer the technology to the gaming sector, assumed problems with efficiency and high costs for implementation have made the industry reluctant to adopt it. We present a multiagent potential field-based bot architecture that is evaluated in two different real-time strategy game settings and compare them, both in terms of performance, and in terms of softer attributes such as configurability with other state-of-the-art solutions.We showthat the solution is a highly configurable bot that can match the performance standards of traditional RTS bots. Furthermore, we show that our approach deals with Fog ofWar (imperfect information about the opponent units) surprisingly well.We also show that amultiagent potential field-based bot is highly competitive in a resource gathering scenario.

Two of the more commonly used heterogeneity tests are Bartlett's and Cochran's, although, as for most of these tests, they may well be more sensitive to violations of the anova assumptions than is anova itself. Simulations were used to examine how well these two tests protected anova against the problems created by variance heterogeneity. Although Cochran's test performed a little better than Bartlett's, both tests performed poorly, frequently disallowing perfectly valid analyses. Recommendations are made about how to proceed, given these results.},

The benefit of using different altitude sequences comes from the fact that higher altitude sequences can be used to guide the motion estimation of the lower ones, thus increasing the robustness and efficiency of the mosaicing process. When compared to the case of single sequence mosaic creation, we show that by combining geometric information from different sequences, we are able to successfully estimate the registration topology of much lower altitude sequences. This results in higher resolution mapping of the sea floor. Illustrative results are presented using sequences of the same coral reef patch, captured with a single video camera. The sequences present some of the common difficulties of underwater 2D mosaicing, namely non-flat, moving environment and changing lighting conditions. The importance of this work is emphasized by fact that the presented methods require inexpensive image acquisition and processing equipment, thus potentially benefiting a very large group of marine scientists},

abstract = {Leg dynamics are often ignored in the real-time control of walking robots because of the high gearing used in leg transmissions. However, the use of a gear reduction high enough to discount Coriolis and centripetal components yields additional non-desired dynamics, which are friction, backlash and elasticity. In such cases, simplifying robot dynamics without considering the effect of gear dynamics leads to unavoidable errors. In order to make dynamic equations reflect the reality of the physical system, it is of paramount importance to model the most significant effects acting on the system. Robot dynamics could then be analyzed and related to trajectory parameters for motion-control purposes. In this paper, a method to derive the dynamics of a robot leg as a function of leg-trajectory parameters is proposed. The method experimentally finds the simplified equations of motion that reflect the reality of the physical system. The resulting model is an accurate and simple representation of the system dynamics, taking into account the most relevant dynamics affecting the system. The simplification of the model allows it to be used in a real-time dynamic-control system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Experiments with two formation controllers for marine unmanned surface vessels are reported. The formation controllers are designed using the nonlinear robust model-based sliding mode approach. The marine vehicles can operate in arbitrary formation configurations by using two leader-follower control schemes. For the design of these controller schemes 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) of surge, sway, and yaw are assumed in the planar motion of the marine surface vessels. Each vessel only has two actuators; therefore, the vessels are underactuated and the lack of a kinematic constraint puts them into the holonomic system category. In this work, the position of a control point on the vessel is controlled, and the orientation dynamics is not directly controlled. Therefore, there is a potential for an oscillatory yaw motion to occur. It is shown that the orientation dynamics, as the internal dynamics of this underactuated system, is stable, i.e., the follower vehicle does not oscillate about its control point during the formation maneuvers. The proposed formation controller relies only on the state information obtained from the immediate neighbors of the vessel and the vessel itself. The effectiveness and robustness of formation control laws in the presence of parameter uncertainty and environmental disturbances are demonstrated by using both simulations and field experiments. The experiments were performed in a natural environment on a lake using a small test boat, and show robust performance to parameter uncertainty and disturbance. This paper reports the first experimental verification of the above mentioned approach, whose unique features are the use of a control point, the zero-dynamic stability analysis, the use of leader-follower method and a nonlinear robust control approach.},

This paper proposes a novel gaitadaptation method based on the maximization of the Normalized Dynamic Energy Stability Margin. This method enables walking-machine gaits to adapt to internal (robot dynamics) and external (environmental) perturbations, including the slope of the terrain, by finding the gait parameters that maximize robot stability. The adaptation method is inspired in the natural gait adaptation carried out by humans and animals to balance external forces or the effect of sloping terrain. Experiments with the SILO4 quadruped robot are presented and show how robot stability is more robust when the proposed approach is used for different external forces and sloping terrains. Using the proposed gaitadaptation approach the robot is able to withstand external forces up to 58{\%} the robot weight and 25-degree slopes.},

We studied dead colonies of Montastraea annularis to obtain information on the main groups present and their relative abundance at Los Roques Archipelago National Park (reefs of Dos Mosquises, Cayo La Pelona, and Cayo Sal). Dead corals were collected at 6-8 m and 9-13 m depth, (3 fragments at each location), and colony volume was estimated for density values standardization. Fragments were broken down in the laboratory and organisms were separated. In all, 1,499 individuals in 8 taxonomic groups were found. The most abundant were sipunculids (57.29{\%}), followed by polychaetes (20.45{\%}), crustaceans (14.76{\%}), nematods, mollusks, and echinoderms. The fauna associated with reefs fragments is highly diverse, but consistently dominated by the same groups.},

abstract = {Mobile robot vision-based navigation has been the source of countless research contributions, from the domains of both vision and control. Vision is becoming more and more common in applications such as localization, automatic map construction, autonomous navigation, path following, inspection, monitoring or risky situation detection. This survey presents those pieces of work, from the nineties until nowadays, which constitute a wide progress in visual navigation techniques for land, aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles. The paper deals with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation. Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics extraction, appearance-based localization, optical flow, features tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc... The recent concept of visual sonar has also been revised.},

abstract = {A simple pendulum model is used to study how feedforward and feedback can be combined to control rhythmic limb movements. I show that a purely feedforward central pattern generator (CPG) is highly sensitive to unexpected disturbances. Pure feedback control analogous to reflex pathways can compensate for disturbances but is sensitive to imperfect sensors. I demonstrate that for systems subject to both unexpected disturbances and sensor noise, a combination of feedforward and feedback can improve performance. This combination is achieved by using a state estimation interpretation, in which a neural oscillator acts as an internal model of limb motion that predicts the state of the limb, and by using alpha-gamma coactivation or its equivalent to generate a sensory error signal that is fed back to entrain the neural oscillator. Such a hybrid feedforward/feedback system can optimally compensate for both disturbances and sensor noise, yet it can also produce fictive locomotion when sensory output is removed, as is observed biologically. CPG behavior arises due to the interaction of the internal model and a feedback control that uses the predicted state. I propose an interpretation of the neural oscillator as a filter for processing sensory information rather than as a generator of commands.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to propose an automatic fish classi-fication system that operates in the natural underwater en-vironment to assist marine biologists in understanding fish behavior. Fish classification is performed by combining two types of features: 1) Texture features extracted by using statistical moments of the gray-level histogram, spatial Ga-bor filtering and properties of the co-occurrence matrix and 2) Shape Features extracted by using the Curvature Scale Space transform and the histogram of Fourier descriptors of boundaries. An affine transformation is also applied to the acquired images to represent fish in 3D by multiple views for the feature extraction. The system was tested on a database containing 360 images of ten different species achieving an average correct rate of about 92{\%}. Then, fish trajectories, extracted using the proposed fish classification combined with a tracking system, are analyzed in order to understand anomalous behavior. In detail, the tracking layer computes fish trajectories, the classification layer associates trajecto-ries to fish species and then by clustering these trajectories we are able to detect unusual fish behaviors to be further investigated by marine biologists.},

abstract = {Habitat complexity is a potential structuring force in benthic communities. Different studies often estimate complexity in different ways, and it is not always clear how precise the separate techniques are. Here we review three methods of estimating surface complexity: stereo photography, profile gauges, and lengths of chain contoured over the substratum. We derived fractal dimensions for the quadrats in the rocky intertidal zone using each technique. Complexity estimates from chains and profile gauges were related, but neither technique was correlated with the results from stereo photographs. Stereo photographs appeared to overestimate complexity on smooth surfaces. The variance of fractal dimension estimates increased nonlinearly with the mean fractal dimension in each quadrat. Recommendations for the number of replicates needed for a reliable estimate of fractal dimension from a quadrat, therefore, vary as a function of surface complexity. Within the range of complexities typically encountered on rocky shores, as few as three profiles or sets of chains can produce relatively reliable estimates of fractal dimension. The most robust and time effective method, however, would be to sample using as many chain profile sets per quadrat as is logistically feasible. Given the changes in precision with surface complexity, comparisons between studies need to take careful note of the number of replicates and the average level of surface complexity. A null result (no relationship between surface complexity and an ecological variable) could be produced by imprecise estimates of surface complexity based on too few replicate measurements per quadrat.},

Main features are, absolute and map-based localization, landmark detection and tracking, and real-time computation (12.5 Hz). The proposed system provides three-dimensional position and orientation of the vehicle along with its velocity. Accuracy of the drift-free estimates is very high, allowing them to be used as feedback measures of a velocity-based low-level controller. The paper details the localization algorithm, by showing some graphical results, and the accuracy of the system.},

abstract = {Plastic spiking neural networks are synthesized for phototactic robots using evolutionary techniques. Synaptic plasticity asymmetrically depends on the precise relative timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes at the millisecond range and on longer-term activity-dependent regulatory scaling. Comparative studies have been carried out for different kinds of plastic neural networks with low and high levels of neural noise. In all cases, the evolved controllers are highly robust against internal synaptic decay and other perturbations. The importance of the precise timing of spikes is demonstrated by randomizing the spike trains. In the low neural noise scenario, weight values undergo rhythmic changes at the mesoscale due to bursting, but during periods of high activity they are finely regulated at the microscale by synchronous or entrained firing. Spike train randomization results in loss of performance in this case. In contrast, in the high neural noise scenario, robots are robust to loss of information in the timing of the spike trains, demonstrating the counterintuitive results that plasticity, which is dependent on precise spike timing, can work even in its absence, provided the behavioral strategies make use of robust longer-term invariants of sensorimotor interaction. A comparison with a rate-based model of synaptic plasticity shows that under similarly noisy conditions, asymmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity achieves better performance by means of efficient reduction in weight variance over time. Performance also presents negative sensitivity to reduced levels of noise, showing that random firing has a functional value.},

abstract = {Obtaining automatic 3D profile of objects is one of the most important issues in computer vision. With this information, a large number of applications become feasible: from visual inspection of industrial parts to 3D reconstruction of the environment for mobile robots. In order to achieve 3D data, range finders can be used. Coded structured light approach is one of the most widely used techniques to retrieve 3D information of an unknown surface. An overview of the existing techniques as well as a new classification of patterns for structured light sensors is presented. This kind of systems belong to the group of active triangulation method, which are based on projecting a light pattern and imaging the illuminated scene from one or more points of view. Since the patterns are coded, correspondences between points of the image(s) and points of the projected pattern can be easily found. Once correspondences are found, a classical triangulation strategy between camera(s) and projector device leads to the reconstruction of the surface. Advantages and constraints of the different patterns are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

Using a new, highly-accurate model of these hydrodynamic interaction forces, which was developed as part of this research, a coordinated arm/vehicle control strategy was implemented. Under this model-based approach, interaction forces acting on the vehicle due to arm motion were predicted and fed forward into the vehicle control system. Using this method, vehicle station-keeping capability was greatly enhanced. Tracking errors and settling times for the manipulator end point were reduced significantly},

We have studied the diet of a colony of Oilbirds in north-eastern Venezuela {\{}Caripe, Monagas State), from July 1985 to January 1988, emphasizing the species composition of the fruit plants utilized, seasonality of fruit availability, energy content and nutrient composition of the fruit pulp, and fruit and seed dimensions. Oilbirds ate the fruits of 19 species of Lauraceae, 9 of palms, 3 of Burseraceae, and 1 of Araliaceae. The proportions to the diet contributed by each of those families, estimated from collections of seeds regurgitated by Oilbirds in the study colony, were: Lauraceae 43.9 {\%}, Palmae 46.5 {\%}, Burseraceae 9.3{\%} and Araliaceae 0.4 {\%}. However, when considering proportions of fruit pul f consumed, Lauraceae {\{}47.1 {\%}) were more important that palms {\{}22.1 {\%}) and Burseraceae {\{}30.7 {\%}). Most species o Lauraceae had a clearly defined, but rather prolonged, fruiting season. Palrns, in contrast, showed little seasonality. Dacryodes trinitensis, the most important Burseraceae eaten, produced fruit at supra-annual intervals. The breeding season of Oilbirds in the study area coincides with the period of maximum Lauraceae fruit availability. The fruits of the most important laurels of the diet begin to ripen in March during the pre-Iaying period, and peak from April, when egg laying begins, through July, when most nests have well-developed young. During the non-breeding season Oilbirds depended mainly on palms. The pulp of Lauraceae fruit had on average, on a dry matter basis, a very high lipid {\{}49.6 {\%}) and eneT content {\{}31.8 k] per g) and a Nitrogen content of 1.47 {\%}. Palms had a lower lipid {\{}12.5 {\%}) and energy content {\{}23.2 k] per g) and a Nitrogen content of 1.52 {\%}. Burseraceae had the highest Nitrogen content {\{}2.38 {\%}). Within the set of fruits used by Oilbirds in our study area no simple pattern emerged between fruit characteristics that could be considered rewarding to the birds {\{}such as energy or Nitrogen content of the¡ ulps) and those, such as seed load, that could be considered costly.

The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible.

abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicle technology continues to advance at a rapid pace. REMUS (Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS), developed by the Oceanographic Systems Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is one of the most widely used autonomous underwater vehicles in the world. Each year REMUS vehicles participate in numerous field exercises in support of scientific and navy research objectives. Designed for coastal operations, REMUS is normally deployed with a CTD, light scattering sensor, side scan sonar and an up-and-down looking acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP). Additional sensors are easily integrated in the vehicle and a bioluminescence instrument and a turbulence sensor package. Recent development efforts have improved the REMUS vehicle overall design and performance, and include integration of two new sensors. Vehicle improvements include lower drag, a new propulsion, new lithium-ion batteries and a new external interface. Maximum speed has been increased from 1.75 m/s to almost 3 m/s (6 knots) and mission length has increased to 22 hours at the 1.5 m/s (3 knots) cruising speed. REMUS has been used to demonstrate a new autonomous underwater vehicle application: plume mapping. A rhodamine fluorometer was installed to map a plume on a steep sloping sea floor. Results from the field test demonstrate the effectiveness of an AUV as a tool in this task. A second REMUS vehicle has been deployed with an optical sensor package. The instruments in the package include a chlorophyll fluorometer and up-and-down looking, seven channel radiometers. This package combined with the standard CTD and ADCP generates a significant scientific data set, which supports both physical and biological oceanographic research},

However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.},

abstract = {Many real-world complex systems consist of a set of elementary units connected by relationships of different kinds. All such systems are better described in terms of multiplex networks, where the links at each layer represent a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes, rather than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of: i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers. The measures we introduce are validated on a genuine multiplex data set of Indonesian terrorists, where information among 78 individuals are recorded with respect to mutual trust, common operations, exchanged communications and business relationships.},

abstract = {We propose an algorithm for semantic segmentation based on 3D point clouds derived from ego-motion. We motivate five simple cues designed to model specific patterns of motion and 3D world structure that vary with object category. We introduce features that project the 3D cues back to the 2D image plane while modeling spatial layout and context. A randomized decision forest combines many such features to achieve a coherent 2D segmentation and recognize the object categories present. Our main contribution is to show how semantic segmentation is possible based solely on motion-derived 3D world structure . Our method works well on sparse, noisy point clouds, and unlike existing approaches, does not need appearance-based descriptors. Experiments were performed on a challenging new video database containing sequences filmed from a moving car in daylight and at dusk. The results confirm that indeed, accurate segmentation and recognition are possible using only motion and 3D world structure. Further, we show that the motion-derived information complements an existing state-of-the-art appearance-based method, improving both qualitative and quantitative performance.},

abstract = {The Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) of Hawai'i was established in 1998 to monitor long-term changes in coral reef benthic communities around the state. Development of the methodology involved analysis of results from previous monitoring programs in Hawai'i to determine precision and statistical power of various methods to detect change. Additional field trials were conducted to examine factors such as repeatability, appropriate transect length, number of transects, number of samples per transect, cover estimation techniques, observer variation, as well as time and financial constraints. Benthic monitoring methods used previously in Hawai'i generally showed low statistical power for detecting change due to low precision and small sample size. Field trials indicated that repeatability of conventional techniques using transects or quadrats had high variation and consequently low statistical power unless efforts were made to reposition the sampling units with greater precision. Longer transects (e.g., 25 and 50 m) had higher variability than shorter transects (e.g., 10 m), suggesting that smaller sampling units were more appropriate for the habitats sampled. Variability among observers analyzing the same data was low in comparison with other sources of error. Visual estimation techniques showed low initial cost but were inefficient per survey. Digital video required the highest initial monetary investment but yielded the greatest quantity of data per survey with sufficient quality. The cost effectiveness of the digital video method compared with other techniques increased with more surveys and in more remote situations where logistical expenses were incurred. A within-habitat stratified random sampling design was implemented for the CRAMP design. Fixed transects were chosen to reduce temporal variance and allowed efficient resurveying under the high-wave-energy field conditions typically found in Hawai'i. The method was designed to detect an absolute change of 10{\%} in benthic cover with high statistical power using 50 points per frame, 20-30 frames per transect, and 8-10 transects per depth. Fixed photoquadrats with high precision and high resolution were included in the design to allow detailed monitoring of coral/algal growth, recruitment, and mortality.},

UAS, Remotely-Piloted Aerial Systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or simply, drones are a hot topic comprising a diverse array of aspects including technology, privacy rights, safety and regulations, and even war and peace. Modern photogrammetry and remote sensing identified the potential of UAS-sourced imagery more than thirty years ago. In the last five years, these two sister disciplines have developed technology and methods that challenge the current aeronautical regulatory framework and their own traditional acquisition and processing methods. Navety and ingenuity have combined off-the-shelf, low-cost equipment with sophisticated computer vision, robotics and geomatic engineering. The results are cm-level resolution and accuracy products that can be generated even with cameras costing a few-hundred euros.

In this paper we present a novel method for real-time camera tracking and 3D reconstruction of static indoor environments using an RGB-D sensor. We show that by representing the geometry with a signed distance function (SDF), the camera pose can be efficiently estimated by directly minimizing the error of the depth images on the SDF. As the SDF contains the distances to the surface for each voxel, the pose optimization can be carried out extremely fast. By iteratively estimating the camera poses and integrating the RGB-D data in the voxel grid, a detailed reconstruction of an indoor environment can be achieved. We present reconstructions of several rooms using a hand-held sensor and from onboard an autonomous quadrocopter. Our extensive evaluation on publicly available benchmark data shows that our approach is more accurate and robust than the iterated closest point algorithm (ICP) used by KinectFusion, and yields often a comparable accuracy at much higher speed to feature-based bundle adjustment methods such as RGB-D SLAM for up to medium-sized scenes.},

abstract = {ANOSIM, PERMANOVA, and the Mantel test are all resemblance-based permutation methods widely used in ecology. Here, we report the results of the first simulation study, to our knowledge, specifically designed to examine the effects of heterogeneity of multivariate dispersions on the rejection rates of these tests and on a classical MANOVA test (Pillai's trace). Increasing differences in dispersion among groups were simulated under scenarios of changing sample sizes, correlation structures, error distributions, numbers of variables, and numbers of groups for balanced and unbalanced one-way designs. The power of these tests to detect environmental impacts or natural large-scale biogeographic gradients was also compared empirically under simulations based on parameters derived from real ecological data sets. Overall, ANOSIM and the Mantel test were very sensitive to heterogeneity in dispersions, with ANOSIM generally being more sensitive than the Mantel test. In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai's trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs. PERMANOVA was also unaffected by differences in correlation structure, unlike Pillai's trace. For unbalanced designs, however, all of the tests were (1) too liberal when the smaller group had greater dispersion and (2) overly conservative when the larger group had greater dispersion, especially ANOSIM and the Mantel test. For simulations based on real ecological data sets, PERMANOVA was generally, but not always, more powerful than the others to detect changes in community structure, and the Mantel test was usually more powerful than ANOSIM. Both the error distributions and the resemblance measure affected results concerning power. Differences in the underlying construction of these test statistics result in important differences in the nature of the null hypothesis they are testing, their sensitivity to heterogeneity, and their power to detect important changes in ecological communities. For balanced designs, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP can be used to rigorously identify location vs. dispersion effects, respectively, in the space of the chosen resemblance measure. ANOSIM and the Mantel test can be used as more ‘‘omnibus'' tests, being sensitive to differences in location, dispersion or correlation structure among groups. Unfortunately, none of the tests (PERMANOVA, Mantel, or ANOSIM) behaved reliably for unbalanced designs in the face of heterogeneity.},

The proposed algorithm overcomes some of the specific challenges associated with underwater visual SLAM, namely, limited field of view imagery and feature-poor regions. It does so by exploiting our SLAM navigation prior within the image registration pipeline and by being selective about which imagery is considered informative in terms of our visual SLAM map. A novel online bag-of-words measure for intra and interimage saliency are introduced and are shown to be useful for image key-frame selection, information-gain-based link hypothesis, and novelty detection. Results from three real-world hull inspection experiments evaluate the overall approach, including one survey comprising a 3.4-h/2.7-km-long trajectory.},

A local FD measure was also computed at each vertex in a cortical surface mesh, visualizing local variations in surface complexity over the brain surface. We analyzed the surface complexity for 87 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (with stable psychopathology and treated with antipsychotic medication) and 108 matched healthy controls. The global FD for the right hemisphere in the schizophrenic group was significantly lower than that in controls. Local FD maps showed that the lower complexity was mainly due to differences in the prefrontal cortex.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional morphology and surface area of organisms such as reef-building corals is central to their biology. Consequently, being able to detect and measure this aspect of corals is critical to understanding their interactions with the surrounding environment. This study explores six different methods of three-dimensional shape and surface area measurements using the range of morphology associated with the Scleractinian corals: Goniopora tenuidens, Acropora intermedia, and Porites cylindrica. Wax dipping; foil wrapping; multi-station convergent photogrammetry that used the naturally occurring optical texture for conjugate point matching; stereo photogrammetry that used projected light to provide optical texture; a handheld laser scanner that employed two cameras and a structured light source; and X-ray computer tomography (CT) scanning were applied to each coral skeleton to determine the spatial resolution of surface detection as well as the accuracy of surface area estimate of each method. Compared with X-ray CT wax dipping provided the best estimate of the surface area of coral skeletons that had external corallites, regardless of morphological complexity. Foil wrapping consistently showed a large degree of error on all coral morphologies. The photogrammetry and laser-scanning solutions were effective only on corals with simple morphologies. The two techniques that used projected lighting were both subject to skeletal light scattering, caused by both gross morphology and meso-coral architecture and which degraded signal triangulation, but otherwise provided solutions with good spatial resolution. X-ray CT scanning provided the highest resolution surface area estimates, detecting surface features smaller than 1000 mu m(2).},

abstract = {Rugosity is a simple measurement of the surface roughness that has been used routinely by coral reef biologists. Areas of high rugosity allow corals to attach and grow on higher substrata not influenced by sand and sediment movement along the bottom. Rugosity of coral reef also reflects the effect of disturbance and stressors on the reef. The aims of this research were to asses the coral reef rugosity in the different environmental condition, the pattern of coral genera biodiversity, and the relationships between rugosity and reef corals biodiversity. The reef corals biodiversity data collection was conducted by Line Intercept Transect. The rugosity of coral reef was measured by carefully laying a steel chain to the reef surface. A rugosity index, C, is calculated as C=1-d/l. where d is horizontal distance covered by chain that follows the contour of the reef and l is its length with fully extended. Comparison of rugosity index between fishing dominated area and tourism dominated area was analysed by independent t-test. Coral genera biodiversity pattern was analyzed using Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN). The relationships between rugosity index and coral biodiversity were analysed using correlation test, linear regression analysis, and second order polynomial regression analysis. A total 44 coral genera were found in the Bunaken National Park and the average of live coral cover is 46{\%}. Porites is the dominant coral genera in the study area. Coral genera can be distinguished in four groups based on its occurrence and cover. An independent t-tes revealed that there was no significant difference between coral reef rugosity index in Bunaken Island and Tombariri. A percent live coral cover is the variable that has highest correlation with coral reef rugosity and then followed by genera richness, Shannon diversity index, and evenness. The highest coefficient of determination of linear regression was found in the linear regression analysis between rugosity index and coral cover (r2=0.321). Tombariri has higher coefficient of determination of linear regression (r2=0.526) than Bunakan Island (r2=0.296). None of second order polynomial regression was significant. Therefore linear regression model can better explain the variation of percent live coral cover, genera richness, Shannon diversity index, and evenness rather than a second order polynomial regression model, at least in the Bunaken National Park. However rugosity index can only explain very low variation of genera richness, diversity index and evenness.},

Traditionally, the image quality of digital cameras has been measured using test-targets and/or subjective tests. Subjective tests should be performed using natural images. It is difficult to establish the relationship between the results of artificial test targets and subjective data, however, because of the different test image types. We propose a framework for objective image quality metrics applied to natural images captured by digital cameras. The framework uses reference images captured by a high-quality reference camera to find image areas with appropriate structural energy for the quality attribute. In this study, the framework was set to measure sharpness. Based on the results, the mean performance for predicting subjective sharpness was clearly higher than that of the state-of-the-art algorithm and test-target sharpness metrics.},

abstract = {Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans have invaded Atlantic reefs and reached much greater population densities than on native reefs. We hypothesized that lionfish on invaded reefs would (1) experience higher kill rates and thus spend less time hunting, given the naivete of Atlantic prey, (2) consume a greater variety of prey, given the lack of native prey defenses, and (3) display less pronounced crepuscular patterns of hunting, given the ease of capturing Atlantic prey. Comparative behavioral observations were conducted in 2 native regions (Philippines and Guam) and 2 invaded regions (Cayman Islands and Bahamas) to assess lionfish time budgets and diurnal activity patterns and to explore correlations between environmental variables and lionfish behavior. Contrary to our first hypothesis, total time allocated to hunting and kill rates showed no difference between native and invaded reefs, despite considerable regional variation. However, Atlantic prey of lionfish were twice as large as Pacific prey, suggesting that despite similar hunting behavior, invasive lionfish ingest greater daily rations of prey biomass. Furthermore, consistent with our second hypothesis, lionfish on invaded reefs had broader diets, and also relied less on 'blowing' behavior for prey capture, pointing to substantial prey naivete in the invaded range. Importantly, only in the invaded range did we observe lionfish consuming parrotfishes, the decline of which could have indirect effects on interactions between seaweeds and corals. Finally, lionfish overall tended to exhibit a crepuscular pattern in behavior whereby hunting peaked at sunrise and/or sunset, with no differences attributable to native vs. invasive status.},

abstract = {Force/position control strategies provide an effective framework to deal with tasks involving interaction with the environment. In this paper the parallel approach to force/position control of robotic manipulators is presented. It shows a complete use of the available sensor measurements by operating the control action in a full-dimensional space without using selection matrices. Conflicting situations between the position and force tasks are managed using a priority strategy: the force control loop is designed to prevail over the position control loop. This choice ensures limited deviations from the prescribed force trajectory in every situation, guaranteeing automatic recovery from unplanned collisions. A dynamic force/position parallel control law is presented and its performance in presence of an elastic environment is analyzed; simplification of the dynamic control law is also discussed leading to a PID-type parallel controller. Two case studies are worked out that show the effectiveness of the approach in application to an industrial robot.},

abstract = {Optical flow cannot be computed locally, since only one independent measurement is available from the image sequence at a point, while the flow velocity has two components. A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image. ?? 1981.},

The two species can usually be identified using dorsal and anal fin ray counts as well as geographic origin, but neither meristics nor geography are always definitive, and their taxonomic status as separate species has been questioned. Analyses of two mitochondria-encoded cytochrome b sequence data sets resolved specimens of P. miles and P. volitans in distinct monophyletic clades. There was also a {\textgreater}4{\%} difference in the maximum intraspecific and minimum interspecific sequence divergences between specimens of the two species. These results are comparable to those of other analyzed Pterois and Dendrochirus sister species, and support their recognition as separate species. The cytochrome b analyses also show that Dendrochirus and Pterois are not reciprocally monophyletic as currently circumscribed, and that a comprehensive study is needed to resolve the taxonomy of Pteroinae genera.},

This phenomenon, known as ocean acidification (OA), has been experimentally shown to impact the biology and ecology of numerous animals and plants2, most notably those that precipitate calcium carbonate skeletons, such as reef-building corals3. Volcanically acidified water at Maug, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is equivalent to near-future predictions for what coral reef ecosystems will experience worldwide due to OA. We provide the first chemical and ecological assessment of this unique site and show that acidification-related stress significantly influences the abundance and diversity of coral reef taxa, leading to the often-predicted shift from a coral to an algae-dominated state4, 5. This study provides field evidence that acidification can lead to macroalgae dominance on reefs.},

abstract = {Recent advances in airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology allow rapid and inexpensive measurements of topography over large areas. This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne LIDAR systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a DTM, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground LIDAR measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.},

We augmented the existing Labatut CGF 2009 method with the ability to cope with these difficult surfaces just by changing the t-edge weights in the construction of surfaces by a minimal s-t cut. Our method uses Visual-Hull to reconstruct the difficult surfaces which are not sampled densely enough by the input 3D point cloud. We demonstrate importance of these surfaces on several real-world data sets. We compare our improvement to our implementation of the Labatut CGF 2009 method and show that our method can considerably better reconstruct difficult surfaces while preserving thin structures and details in the same quality and computational time.},

The fundamental goal of this work is to concurrently sstimate online current vehicle position and its past trajectory. This goal is framed within the context of improving mobile robot navigation to support sub-sea science and exploration. Vehicle trajectory is represented by a history of poses in an augmented state Kalman filter. Camera spatial constraints from overlapping imagery provide partial observation of these posa and are used to enforce consislency and provide a mechanism for loop-closure. The multi-sensor camera+navigation framework is shown to have compelling advantages over a camera-only based approach by 1) improving the robustness of pairwise image registration, 2) setting the free gauge scale, and 3) allowing for a unconnected camera graph topology. Results are shown for a real world data set collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle in an unstructured undersea environment.},

Over a nine year period from 1988 to 1997, its various field programs resulted in the discovery of the largest concentration of ancient ships ever found in the deep sea. In all, eight ships were located in an area of 210 km2, including five of the Roman era spanning a period of time from 100 B.C. to 400 A.D., documenting the existence of a major trading route in the central Mediterranean Sea between ancient Carthage, Rome, Sicily, and Sardinia. The project involved the use of highly sophisticated deep submergence technologies including towed acoustic and visual search vehicles, a nuclear research submarine, and an advanced remotely operated vehicle. Precision navigation and control permitted rapid yet careful mapping, both visual and acoustic, of each site with a degree of precision never attained before. Advanced robotics permitted the recovery of selected objects for subsequent analysis without intrusive excavation. This multi-disciplinary effort of archaeologists, oceanographers, and ocean engineers demonstrated that deep water archaeology has great promise and can be done without the exploitation of ancient sites for private gains. The Project also demonstrated that in the absence of evolving laws of the sea, a great deal of human history may be at peril. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reports the novel insight that the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) information matrix is exactly sparse in a delayed-state framework. Such a framework is used in view-based representations of the environment that rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data to obtain virtual observations of robot motion with respect to a place it has previously been. The exact sparseness of the delayed-state information matrix is in contrast to other recent feature-based SLAM information algorithms, such as sparse extended information filter or thin junction-tree filter, since these methods have to make approximations in order to force the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be sparse. The benefit of the exact sparsity of the delayed-state framework is that it allows one to take advantage of the information space parameterization without incurring any sparse approximation error. Therefore, it can produce equivalent results to the full-covariance solution. The approach is validated experimentally using monocular imagery for two datasets: a test-tank experiment with ground truth, and a remotely operated vehicle survey of the RMS Titanic},

abstract = {We present a real-time, accurate, large-scale monocular visual odometry system for real-world autonomous outdoor driving applications. The key contributions of our work are a series of architectural innovations that address the challenge of robust multithreading even for scenes with large motions and rapidly changing imagery. Our design is extensible for three or more parallel CPU threads. The system uses 3D-2D correspondences for robust pose estimation across all threads, followed by local bundle adjustment in the primary thread. In contrast to prior work, epipolar search operates in parallel in other threads to generate new 3D points at every frame. This significantly boosts robustness and accuracy, since only extensively validated 3D points with long tracks are inserted at keyframes. Fast-moving vehicles also necessitate immediate global bundle adjustment, which is triggered by our novel keyframe design in parallel with pose estimation in a thread-safe architecture. To handle inevitable tracking failures, a recovery method is provided. Scale drift is corrected only occasionally, using a novel mechanism that detects (rather than assumes) local planarity of the road by combining information from triangulated 3D points and the inter-image planar homography. Our system is optimized to output pose within 50 ms in the worst case, while average case operation is over 30 fps. Evaluations are presented on the challenging KITTI dataset for autonomous driving, where we achieve better rotation and translation accuracy than other state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {Scale drift is a crucial challenge for monocular autonomous driving to emulate the performance of stereo. This paper presents a real-time monocular SFM system that corrects for scale drift using a novel cue combination framework for ground plane estimation, yielding accuracy comparable to stereo over long driving sequences. Our ground plane estimation uses multiple cues like sparse features, dense inter-frame stereo and (when applicable) object detection. A data-driven mechanism is proposed to learn models from training data that relate observation covariances for each cue to error behavior of its underlying variables. During testing, this allows per-frame adaptation of observation covariances based on relative confidences inferred from visual data. Our framework significantly boosts not only the accuracy of monocular self-localization, but also that of applications like object localization that rely on the ground plane. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the accuracy of our ground plane estimation, monocular SFM and object localization relative to ground truth, with detailed comparisons to prior art.},

abstract = {Visual SLAM systems aim to estimate the motion of a moving camera together with the geometric structure and appearance of the world being observed. To the extent that this is possible using only an image stream, the core problem that must be solved by any practical visual SLAM system is that of obtaining correspondence throughout the images captured. Modern visual SLAM pipelines commonly obtain correspondence by using sparse feature matching techniques and construct maps using a composition of point, line or other simple geometric primitives. The resulting sparse feature map representations provide sparsely furnished, incomplete reconstructions of the observed scene. Related techniques from multiple view stereo (MVS) achieve high quality dense recon- struction by obtaining dense correspondences over calibrated image sequences. Despite the usefulness of the resulting dense models, these techniques have been of limited use in visual SLAM systems. The computational complexity of estimating dense surface geome- try has been a practical barrier to its use in real-time SLAM. Furthermore, MVS algorithms have typically required a fixed length, calibrated image sequence to be available throughout the optimisation—a condition fundamentally at odds with the online nature of SLAM. With the availability of massively-parallel commodity computing hardware, we demon- strate new algorithms that achieve high quality incremental dense reconstruction within online visual SLAM. The result is a live dense reconstruction (LDR) of scenes that makes possible numerous applications that can utilise online surface modelling, for instance: plan- ning robot interactions with unknown objects, augmented reality with characters that in- teract with the scene, or providing enhanced data for object recognition. The core of this thesis goes beyond LDR to demonstrate fully dense visual SLAM. We re- place the sparse feature map representation with an incrementally updated, non-parametric, dense surface model. By enabling real-time dense depth map estimation through novel short baseline MVS, we can continuously update the scene model and further leverage its predictive capabilities to achieve robust camera pose estimation with direct whole image alignment. We demonstrate the capabilities of dense visual SLAM using a single mov- ing passive camera, and also when real-time surface measurements are provided by a commodity depth camera. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art, pick-up-and-play 3D reconstruction and camera tracking systems useful in many real world scenarios.},

Unlike traditional methods which may get trapped in local minima due to the non-convex nature of these problems, this approach provides a theoretical guarantee of global optimality. The formulation relies on recent developments in fractional programming and the theory of convex underestimators and allows a unified framework for minimizing the standard L-2-norm of reprojection errors which is optimal under Gaussian noise as well as the more robust L-1-norm which is less sensitive to outliers. Even though the worst case complexity of our algorithm is exponential, the practical efficacy is empirically demonstrated by good performance on experiments for both synthetic and real data. An open source MATLAB toolbox that implements the algorithm is also made available to facilitate further research.},

The algorithm enforces the rank degeneracy and the positive semidefiniteness of the dual quadric as part of the estimation procedure, rather than as a post-processing step. Furthermore, the method allows the user, if he or she so desires, to enforce conditions on the plane at infinity so that the reconstruction satisfies the chirality constraints. The algorithm works by constructing low degree polynomial optimization problems, which are solved to their global optimum using a series of convex linear matrix inequality relaxations. The algorithm is fast, stable, robust and has time complexity independent of the number of views. We show extensive results on synthetic as well as real datasets to validate our algorithm.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for performing Lambertian pho- tometric stereo in the presence of shadows. The algorithm has three novel features. First, a fast graph cuts based method is used to estimate per pixel light source visibility. Second, it allows images to be acquired with multiple illu- minants, and there can be fewer images than light sources. This leads to better surface coverage and improves the re- construction accuracy by enhancing the signal to noise ratio and the condition number of the light source matrix. The ability to use fewer images than light sources means that the imaging effort grows sublinearly with the number of light sources. Finally, the recovered shadow maps are combined with shading information to perform constrained surface normal integration. This reduces the low frequency bias inherent to the normal integration process and ensures that the recovered surface is consistent with the shadowing con- figuration The algorithm works with as few as four light sources and four images. We report results for light source visibil- ity detection and high quality surface reconstructions for synthetic and real datasets.},

abstract = {Topographic data measurement is a fundamental aspect of many geomorphic research applications, particularly those including landform monitoring and investigation of changes in topography. However, most surveying techniques require relatively expensive technologies or specialized user supervision. Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric technology reduces both these constraints by allowing the use of consumer grade digital cameras and highly automated data processing, which can be free to use. SfM photogrammetry therefore offers the possibility of fast, automated and low-cost acquisition of 3-D data, which has inevitably created great interest amongst the geomorphological community. In this contribution, the basic concepts of SfM photogrammetry are presented, whilst recognising its heritage. A few examples are employed to illustrate the potential of SfM applications for geomorphological research. In particular, SfM photogrammetry offers to geomorphologists a tool for high-resolution characterisation of 3-D forms at a range of scales and for change detection purposes. The high level of automation of SfM data processing creates both opportunities and threats, particularly because user control tends to focus upon visualisation of the final product rather than upon inherent data quality. Accordingly, this contribution seeks to guide potential new users in successfully applying SfM for a range of geomorphic studies. ISSN 2047-0371},

abstract = {Morphological variation in marine sessile organisms is frequently related to environmental factors. Quantifying such variation is relevant in a range of ecological studies. For example, analyzing the growth form of fossil organisms may indicate the state of the physical environment in which the organism lived. A quantitative morphological comparison is important in studies where marine sessile organisms are transplanted from one environment to another. This study presents a method for the quantitative analysis of three-dimensional (3D) images of scleractinian corals obtained with X-ray Computed Tomography scanning techniques. The advantage of Computed Tomography scanning is that a full 3D image of a complex branching object, including internal structures, can be obtained with a very high precision. There are several complications in the analysis of this data set. In the analysis of a complex branching object, landmark-based methods usually do not work and different approaches are required where various artifacts (for example cavities, holes in the skeleton, scanning artifacts, etc.) in the data set have to be removed before the analysis. A method is presented, which is based on the construction of a medial axis and a combination of image-processing techniques for the analysis of a 3D image of a complex branching object where the complications mentioned above can be overcome. The method is tested on a range of 3D images of samples of the branching scleractinian coral Madracis mirabilis collected at different depths. It is demonstrated that the morphological variation of these samples can be quantified, and that biologically relevant morphological characteristics, like branch-spacing and surface/volume ratios, can be computed.},

abstract = {The structural complexity of coral reefs profoundly affects the biodiversity, productivity, and overall functionality of reef ecosystems. Conventional survey techniques utilize 2-dimensional metrics that are inadequate for accurately capturing and quantifying the intricate structural complexity of scleractinian corals. A 3-dimensional (3D) approach improves the capacity to accurately measure architectural complexity, topography, rugosity, volume, and other structural characteristics that play a significant role in habitat facilitation and ecosystem processes. This study utilized Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry techniques to create 3D mesh models for several Hawaiian corals that represent distinct morphological phenotypes. The orthophotos and digital elevation models generated from the SfM process were imported into geospatial analysis software in order to quantify several metrics pertaining to 3D complexity that are known to affect ecosystem biodiversity and productivity. The 3D structural properties of the reconstructed coral colonies were statistically analyzed to determine if the each species represents a unique morpho-functional group. The SfM reconstruction techniques described in this paper can be utilized for an array of research purposes to improve our understanding of how changes in coral composition affect habitat structure and ecological processes in coral reef ecosystems.},

The three-dimensional (3D) size and structure of corals are directly related to many ecosystem values and functions. Most methods to estimate colony surface area have been limited to laboratory settings and cannot be used for field corals. Photographic methods for digital 3D reconstruction were applied here to determine the accuracy of three different approaches for estimating colony surface area of field corals from simple underwater measurements. The approaches include a volumetric size-class method, a hemispherical surrogate and a suite of log-linear models generated from stepwise multiple regression analyses of digitally-reconstructed colonies. For each approach, surface area values were calculated from field measurements of colony size and the accuracy was determined by comparison with digitally-derived values for the same colonies. Accuracy varied among approaches; log-linear models (12{\%} difference) were most accurate, followed by the hemispherical surrogate (17{\%} difference) and size-classes (40{\%} difference). The log-linear and hemispherical surrogate approaches are potentially applicable to at least nine common coral species. The photographic reconstruction method, although time-consuming and not intended for routine application, was shown by comparison with laser-scanned images to provide a highly accurate method for determining 3D colony surface area.},

Assuming that stereo camera calibration and camera motion are known, our method is able to reconstruct accurately dense 3D models of urban environments in the form of point clouds in near real-time. We take advantage of recent stereo matching techniques that are able to build dense and accurate disparity maps from two rectified images. Then, we fuse the information from multiple disparity maps into a global model by using an efficient data association technique that takes into account stereo uncertainty and performs geometric and photometric consistency validation in a multi-view setup. Finally, we use efficient voxel grid filtering techniques to deal with storage requirements in large-scale environments. In addition, our method automatically discards possible moving obstacles in the scene. We show experimental results on real video large-scale sequences and compare our approach with respect to other state-of-the-art methods such as PMVS and StereoScan.},

abstract = {Marine mammal mass strandings have occurred for millions of years, but their origins defy singular explanations. Beyond human causes, mass strandings have been attributed to herding behaviour, large-scale oceanographic fronts and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Because algal toxins cause organ failure in marine mammals, HABs are the most common mass stranding agent with broad geographical and widespread taxonomic impact. Toxin-mediated mortalities in marine food webs have the potential to occur over geological timescales, but direct evidence for their antiquity has been lacking. Here, we describe an unusually dense accumulation of fossil marine vertebrates from Cerro Ballena, a Late Miocene locality in Atacama Region of Chile, preserving over 40 skeletons of rorqual whales, sperm whales, seals, aquatic sloths, walrus-whales and predatory bony fish. Marine mammal skeletons are distributed in four discrete horizons at the site, representing a recurring accumulation mechanism. Taphonomic analysis points to strong spatial focusing with a rapid death mechanism at sea, before being buried on a barrier-protected supratidal flat. In modern settings, HABs are the only known natural cause for such repeated, multispecies accumulations. This proposed agent suggests that upwelling zones elsewhere in the world should preserve fossil marine vertebrate accumulations in similar modes and densities.},

This system will allow localization and path following along a trained route without the necessity of a globally referenced position estimate. Previous QNS work has been on terrestrial robots using optical images. Our main challenge lies in utilization of side scan sonar as the imaging medium, as this type of sonar is prevalent on AUVs and provides much better range and coverage than optics in water. To achieve this, a sonar image processing and registration framework has been developed. To be useful such a framework should be fully-autonomous, robust, and operate in real-time, where real-time operation is defined as the ability to process, register and localize data at the rate it is collected, or faster. In this paper we describe our framework for processing sonar data, generating image tiles, extracting unique features and localizing against a reference set. We also present some results of this system based on raw sonar input data collected by the AUV.},

Rigorous testing of underwater acoustic communication systems is necessary to develop a dependable network, however, the high offshore testing costs make this difficult. Though simulators could aid the development of such AUV communication systems, the few existing simulators focus upon simulating a single vehicle and, as such, do not provide tools for simulating underwater communication systems. In this paper we present an underwater communications simulation framework designed for the Unified System for Automation and Robotics Simulator (USARSim).

abstract = {Waves on the water surface create spatio-temporal illumination patterns underwater. Concave regions on the surface diverge light rays refracting into the water, while convex regions create convergence of rays (caustics). Therefore, the natural illumination of underwater objects is spatially varying. Moreover, in shallow water this nonuniform intensity distribution varies significantly in time, as the water surface changes with the wave motion. In this paper we present a method that attenuates these illumination patterns, and results in an image which appears as if taken under much more stable and uniform illumination. The method is based on just a few consecutive frames taken of the scene. These frames are analyzed by a non-linear algorithm which preserves consistent image components while filtering out fluctuations. The use of the nonlinear algorithm alleviates the need for long acquisition periods and is therefore fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in underwater experiments},

abstract = {This paper presents a set of algorithms for the creation of underwater mosaics and illustrates their use as visual maps for underwater vehicle navigation. First, we describe the automatic creation of video mosaics, which deals with the problem of image motion estimation in a robust and automatic way. The motion estimation is based on a initial matching of corresponding areas over pairs of images, followed by the use of a robust matching technique, which can cope with a high percentage of incorrect matches. Several motion models, established under the projective geometry framework, allow for the creation of high quality mosaics where no assumptions are made about the camera motion. Several tests were run on underwater image sequences, testifying to the good performance of the implemented matching and registration methods. Next, we deal with the issue of determining the 3D position and orientation of a vehicle from new views of a previously created mosaic. The problem of pose estimation is tackled, using the available information on the camera intrinsic parameters. This information ranges from the full knowledge to the case where they are estimated using a self-calibration technique based on the analysis of an image sequence captured under pure rotation. The performance of the 3D positioning algorithms is evaluated using images for which accurate ground truth is available.},

abstract = {Lately, underwater vehicles have become important tools for exploration, monitoring and creation of maps of the seabed. Within mapping applications, the maps obtained from optical data are becoming essential in different study areas such as biological, geological and archaeological surveys, or in detection of benthic temporal changes. However, the underwater medium is very challenging for optical sensors and does not allow the area of interest to be imaged in a single image. Therefore, image mosaicing methods are necessary. Although recent advances in detection of correspondences between images have resulted in highly effective image registration methods, global alignment methods are still needed to obtain a globally coherent mosaic. In this paper, we propose a new global alignment method which works on the mosaic frame and does not require non-linear optimisation. Additionally, a simple image rectifying method is presented to reduce the down-scaling effect which might occur when minimising errors defined in the mosaic frame. Moreover, this rectifying method can also be seen as an alternative and straightforward way of incorporating different sensor information if available. The proposed framework has been tested with underwater image sequences. The resulting method is faster than its counterparts while providing the same level of registration quality. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Information with$\backslash$nwhich to construct a reservoir model must therefore be based on$\backslash$ninformation gathered from wells or outcrops transecting the sequence of$\backslash$ninterest. Most (particularly exploration wells) are vertical, presenting$\backslash$na problem for geostatistical modeling. While understanding vertical$\backslash$nstratal stacking is straightforward, it is difficult to obtain lateral$\backslash$nfacies information. Though in some situations outcrop surfaces, seismic$\backslash$ndata, and horizontal wells may somewhat mitigate this bias, the$\backslash$nlikelihood remains that the lateral dimension of a buried system will be$\backslash$nvastly undersampled with respect to the vertical.

abstract = {With the current availability of high quality optical sensors and the advancements of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), it is becoming increasingly accessible to acquire extremely large sets of benthic habitat images. Manual characterization and classification of such large number of images for relevant geological or benthic features can become very difficult and time consuming. This paper presents a novel method for automated segmentation, classification and thematic mapping of bacterial mat from shell chaff and sand, on mosaics created from an image survey on the North Sea. The proposed method uses completed Gabor filter response, grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary pattern (CLBP) as feature descriptors. After chi-square and Hellinger kernel mapping of feature vector, Probability Density Weighted Mean Distance (PDWMD) is used for classification. Initial segmentation is done using TurboPixels. Our proposed method achieves the highest overall classification accuracy and have moderate execution times compared with the set of methods that are representative of the state-of-the-art in automated classification of seabed images. Our work illustrates that applying automated classification techniques to mosaic composites produces a rapid (in terms of expert annotation time) technique of characterizing benthic areas that can be used to track changes over time.},

abstract = {This paper considers the application of feature-based simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) using a random finite sets (RFS) framework for an autonomous underwater vehicle. SLAM allows for reduction in localisation error by tracking features which provide a fixed external reference. The SLAM problem is addressed here using a single-cluster probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. The filter uses a particle approximation for the vehicle position with a conditional Gaussian mixture PHD for the feature map. Map features are selected as unique point features generated from a stereo camera on-board the vehicle. We demonstrate the improvement in localisation applying the algorithm to a dataset obtained in an indoor test tank.},

The goal of this survey was to create a fast but detailed map of the site, to serve as a base map for subsequent archaeological intervention. The paper overviews the survey setup and the methods used to generate a high resolution optical map. It also highlights some of the important advantages that lightweight AUVs present for archaeological survey missions in terms of operational costs, survey time, the quality of both the acquired data and the mapping outcome, and access to deep sites that are not reachable by traditional archaeological methods.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, several image mosaicingmeth- ods have been proposed in robotic mapping and remote sensing applications. Owing to the rapid developments on obtaining optical data from areas beyond human reach, there is a high demand from different scientists for creating large-area image mosaics often using images as the only source of information. One of the most important steps in the mosaicing process is the motion estimation between overlapping images to obtain the topology, i.e, the spatial relationships between images. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for feature-based image mosaicing capable of obtaining the topology with a reduced number of matching attempts and to get the best possible trajectory estimation. Innovative aspects include the use of a fast image similarity criterion combined with a minimum spanning tree (MST) solution, to obtain a tentative topology. This topology is improved by attempting image matching over the pairs of higher overlap evidence. Unlike previous approaches for large- area mosaicing, our framework is able to naturally deal with the cases where time consecutive images cannot be matched successfully, such as completely unordered sets. We conclude this paper by presenting an environmental application of this mosaicing},

abstract = {A major obstacle to processing images of the ocean floor comes from the absorption and scattering effects of the light in the aquatic environment. Due to the absorption of the natural light, underwater vehicles often require artificial light sources attached to them to provide the adequate illumination. Unfortunately, these flashlights tend to illuminate the scene in a nonuniform fashion, and, as the vehicle moves, induce shadows in the scene. For this reason, the first step towards application of standard computer vision techniques to underwater imaging requires dealing first with these lighting problems. This paper analyses and compares existing methodologies to deal with low-contrast, nonuniform illumination in underwater image sequences. The reviewed techniques include: (i) study of the illumination-reflectance model, (ii) local histogram equalization, (iii) homomorphic filtering, and, (iv) subtraction of the illumination field. Several experiments on real data have been conducted to compare the different approaches.},

The unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) is a low cost vehicle which can be carried close to the disaster site and flown to capture aerial images without any delay. This paper presents some techniques for UAV image mosaicing from a series of overlapped snapshot images. The process can be divided into three steps. The first step is to detect the feature points. The second step is to find the corresponding feature points between two images. The last step is to obtain the transformations for image mosaic using the corresponding points. In the second step, it is difficult to check up corresponding feature points because the feature points may be spurious. We proposed a method to solve this problem.

abstract = {Estimating dense 3D scene flow from stereo sequences remains a challenging task, despite much progress in both classical disparity and 2D optical flow estimation. To overcome the limitations of existing techniques, we introduce a novel model that represents the dynamic 3D scene by a collection of planar, rigidly moving, local segments. Scene flow estimation then amounts to jointly estimating the pixel-to-segment assignment, and the 3D position, normal vector, and rigid motion parameters of a plane for each segment. The proposed energy combines an occlusion-sensitive data term with appropriate shape, motion, and segmentation regularizers. Optimization proceeds in two stages: Starting from an initial super pixelization, we estimate the shape and motion parameters of all segments by assigning a proposal from a set of moving planes. Then the pixel-to-segment assignment is updated, while holding the shape and motion parameters of the moving planes fixed. We demonstrate the benefits of our model on different real-world image sets, including the challenging KITTI benchmark. We achieve leading performance levels, exceeding competing 3D scene flow methods, and even yielding better 2D motion estimates than all tested dedicated optical flow techniques.},

Examples of underwater targets of interest include AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) as well as manned sub- mersibles, divers, and even marine animals. When compared with classical systems, the class of underwater acoustic positioning systems considered in this paper is far more versa- tile and portable and the costs of operation are greatly reduced. This justifies the increasing interest that such systems have received over the past few years, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint. Research and development in this area have progressed to the point where a commercial product made its appearance in the market: the so-called GIB (GPS Intelligent Buoys). However, much work remains to be done towards the develop- ment of operational systems capable of yielding adequate performance in the presence of multi-path effects and acoustic outliers. The paper gives a brief overview of this area of research and discusses theoretical and practical issues that arise in the development and operation of acoustic positioning systems at sea.},

By enforcing the $\backslash$ncoplanarity of epipolar plane normal vectors, it constrains the three degrees of $\backslash$nfreedom of the relative rotation between two camera views directly-independently $\backslash$nof the translation. The present paper shows how the approach can be extended to $\backslash$nn points, and translated into an efficient eigenvalue minimization over the $\backslash$nthree rotational degrees of freedom. Each iteration in the non-linear $\backslash$noptimization has constant execution time, independently of the number of $\backslash$nfeatures. Two global optimization approaches are proposed.

abstract = {Scene understanding is an important yet very challeng- ing problem in computer vision. In the past few years, researchers have taken advantage of the recent diffusion of depth-RGB (RGB-D) cameras to help simplify the problem of inferring scene semantics. However, while the added 3D geometry is certainly useful to segment out objects with different depth values, it also adds complications in that the 3D geometry is often incorrect because of noisy depth measurements and the actual 3D extent of the objects is usually unknown because of occlusions. In this paper we propose a new method that allows us to jointly refine the 3D reconstruction of the scene (raw depth values) while accurately segmenting out the objects or scene elements from the 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by introducing a new model which we called Voxel-CRF. The Voxel-CRF model is based on the idea of constructing a conditional random field over a 3D volume of interest which captures the semantic and 3D geometric relationships among different elements (voxels) of the scene. Such model allows to jointly estimate (1) a dense voxel-based 3D reconstruction and (2) the semantic labels associated with each voxel even in presence of par- tial occlusions using an approximate yet efficient inference strategy. We evaluated our method on the challenging NYU Depth dataset (Version 1 and 2). Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy in inferring scene semantics and visually appealing results in improving the quality of the 3D reconstruction. We also demonstrate an interesting application of object removal and scene com- pletion from RGB-D images.},

Previous works on solving this categorization problem are mostly based on the analysis of underwater images. In our work, we design a system capable of categorizing underwater habitats based on underwater video content analysis since the temporally correlated information may make contribution to the categorization task. However, the task is very challenging since the underwater scene in the video is continuously varying because of the changing scene and surface conditions, lighting, and the viewpoint. To that end, we investigate the utility of two approaches to underwater video classification: the common spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) and the video texture dynamic systems, where we model the underwater footage using dynamic textures and construct a categorization framework using the approach of the Bag-of-Systems(BoSs). We also introduce a new underwater video data set, which is composed of more than 100 hours of annotated video sequences. Our results indicate that, for the underwater habitat identification, the dynamic texture approach has multiple benefits over the traditional STIP-based video modeling.},

It allows to ben- efit from the simplicity and accuracy of dense tracking – which does not depend on visual features – while running in real-time on a CPU. The key idea is to continuously estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, which in turn is used to track the motion of the camera using dense image alignment. More specifically, we estimate the depth of all pixels which have a non-negligible image gradient. Each estimate is represented as a Gaussian probability distribution over the inverse depth. We propagate this information over time, and update it with new measurements as new images arrive. In terms of tracking accuracy and computational speed, the proposed method compares favorably to both state-of-the-art dense and feature-based visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. As our method runs in real-time on a CPU, it is of large practical value for robotics and augmented reality applications. 1.Towards},

Although epipolar geometry also gets distorted, there is a set of special epipolar lines that remain straight, namely those that go through the distortion center. By finding these straight epipolar lines in camera pairs we can obtain constraints on the distortion center(s) without any calibration object or plumbline assumptions in the scene. Although this holds for all radial distortion models we conceptually prove this idea using the division distortion model and the radial fundamental matrix which allow for a very simple closed form solution of the distortion center from two views (same distortion) or three views (different distortions). The non-iterative nature of our approach makes it immune to local minima and allows finding the distortion center also for cropped images or those where no good prior exists. Besides this, we give comprehensive relations between different undistortion models and discuss advantages and drawbacks.},

abstract = {A new real-time obstacle avoidance method for mobile robots has been developed and implemented. This method, named the Vector Field Histogram (VFH), permits the detection of unknown obstacles and avoids collisions while simultaneously steering the mobile robot toward the target. A VFH-controlled mobile robot maneuvers quickly and without stopping among densely cluttered obstacles. The VFH method uses a two-dimensional Cartesian Histogram Grid as a world model. This world model is updated continuously and in real-time with range data sampled by the onboard ultrasonic range sensors. Based on the accumulated environmental data, the VFH method then computes a one-dimensional Polar Histogram that is constructed around the robot's momentary location. Each sector in the Polar Histogram holds the polar obstacle density in that direction. Finally, the algorithm selects the most suitable sector from among all Polar Histogram sectors with low obstacle density, and the steering of the robot is aligned with that direction. Experimental results from a mobile robot traversing a densely cluttered obstacle course at an average speed of 0.7 m/sec demonstrate the power of the VFH method.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching is a significant contributor to the worldwide degradation of coral reefs and is indicative of the termination of symbiosis between the coral host and its symbiotic algae (dinoflagellate; Symbiodinium sp. complex), usually by expulsion or xenophagy (symbiophagy) of its dinoflagellates. Herein, we provide evidence that during the earliest stages of environmentally induced bleaching, heat stress and light stress generate distinctly different pathomorphological changes in the chloroplasts, while a combined heat- and light-stress exposure induces both pathomorphologies; suggesting that these stressors act on the dinoflagellate by different mechanisms. Within the first 48 hours of a heat stress (32°C) under low-light conditions, heat stress induced decomposition of thylakoid structures before observation of extensive oxidative damage; thus it is the disorganization of the thylakoids that creates the conditions allowing photo-oxidative-stress. Conversely, during the first 48 hours of a light stress (2007 µmoles m(-2) s(-1) PAR) at 25°C, condensation or fusion of multiple thylakoid lamellae occurred coincidently with levels of oxidative damage products, implying that photo-oxidative stress causes the structural membrane damage within the chloroplasts. Exposure to combined heat- and light-stresses induced both pathomorphologies, confirming that these stressors acted on the dinoflagellate via different mechanisms. Within 72 hours of exposure to heat and/or light stresses, homeostatic processes (e.g., heat-shock protein and anti-oxidant enzyme response) were evident in the remaining intact dinoflagellates, regardless of the initiating stressor. Understanding the sequence of events during bleaching when triggered by different environmental stressors is important for predicting both severity and consequences of coral bleaching.},

It consists of a pair of hydraulic-driven master-slave teleoperated manipulators, placed on top of an insulated boom, which execute directly on the hot line, the tasks commanded via master arms by an operator on the ground. Telepresence of the operator is accomplished through a 3-D vision system, a multimedia interface and the force-feedback capabilities of the manipulators.

As a single hand-held RGB camera flies over a static scene, we estimate detailed textured depth maps at selected keyframes to produce a surface patchwork with millions of vertices. We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and DTAM achieves real-time performance using current commodity GPU hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

Our method maintains high accuracy by regularly re-triangulating the feature matches that initially fail to triangulate.

PhotoModeler software was used to process the images and build a 3-D model of the object, which was subsequently analyzed using 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) packages. The accuracy of the technique was tested on irregularly shaped polystyrene models of known dimensions and on preserved coral skeletons. The technique was applied to the quantitative assessment of partial mortality in corals, but many applications are possible, including surface area measurements to standardize ecophysiological studies in the field and morphometric analyses. It represents the only noninvasive technique we are aware of for determining surface areas of large corals in the field. The most serious limitation of the technique is the time-consuming nature of the process, which increases with the complexity of the object and precludes many routine applications.},

The aim of this document is to propose a newmethod for solving the homography decomposition problem. This newmethod provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

The vehicle is equipped with a down-looking camera which is used to compute its motion with respect to the seafloor. As the mosaic increases in size, a systematic bias is introduced in the alignment of the images which form the mosaic. Therefore, this accumulative error produces a drift in the estimation of the position of the vehicle. When the arbitrary trajectory of the AUV crosses over itself, it is possible to reduce this propagation of image alignment errors within the mosaic. A Kalman filter with augmented state is proposed to optimally estimate both the visual map and the vehicle position.},

abstract = {Perspective camera calibration has been a research subject for a large group of researchers. However, only a small number of those methods base their approaches on the use of monoplane calibration points. We developed one of those methodologies using monoplane calibration points to perform an explicit three-dimensional (3-D) camera calibration. This methodology is based on an iterative approach. To avoid the singularities obtained with the calibration equations when monoplane calibration points are used, this method computes the calibration parameters in a multistep procedure and requires a first-guess solution for the intrinsic parameters. These intrinsic parameters are updated and their accuracy increased during the iterative procedure. All computations required are linear and in addition to the extrinsic parameters the proposed method also computes the first coefficient of the radial distortion (k1) and the skew angle. A first-guess value for the focal length of the lens is required but its value is iteratively updated using the Gauss lens model. This methodology also includes the uncertainty horizontal image scale factor (Sx) on the set of calibration parameters to be computed, which makes this approach independent of the accuracy of the horizontal scale factor. The proposed methodology has the advantage that it can be used with monoplane calibration data with no restrictions for the pose geometry of the camera. In this approach the pose estimation problem is treated separately, computing the pose orientation of the camera in a first step and using this information to compute the pose location. A model for the expected stability of the camera look angles from noisy image data and its stability analysis as a function of the pose geometry of the camera is presented. Several experimental and simulated analyzes were performed and are presented},

Against the common belief in the field of geometric vision that it is not possible to find one independently of the other, we show how this can be achieved by relatively simple two-view constraints. We use the fact that translation and rotation cause fundamentally different flow fields on the unit sphere centered around the camera. This allows to establish independent constraints on translation and rotation, and the latter is solved using the Gr{\"{o}}bner basis method. The rotation computation is completed by a solution to the cheiriality problem that depends neither on translation, nor on feature triangulations. Notably, we show for the first time how the constraint on the rotation has the advantage of remaining exact even in the case of translations converging to zero. We use this fact in order to remove the error caused by model selection via a non-linear optimization of rotation hypotheses. We show that our method operates in real-time and compare it to a standard existing approach in terms of both speed and accuracy.},

This novel approach allows a better uncertainty modeling of both low and high parallax features and reduces the likelihood of inconsistencies.

Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera.},

abstract = {The ability of a robot to localise itself and simultaneously build a map of its environment (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or Concurrent Mapping and Localisation (CML)) is a fundamental characteristic required for its autonomous operation. Classically laser and sonar sensors have been used for performing SLAM but during the last decade a significant amount of research has been carried out on SLAM using vision sensors. Vision Sensors/Cameras are low-cost, light and compact, easily available, offer passive sensing, have low power consumption and provide rich information about the environment enabling the detection of stable features. These features make cameras very attractive to be used for SLAM. Different types of imaging systems have been used to carry out SLAM including single cameras, stereo camera pairs, multiple camera rigs and catadioptric sensors. A single acquisition from a single camera only provides direction of the observed features while one acquisition from a stereo pair can provide 3D location of the observed features. Catadioptric sensors offer a 360° field of view but with non-uniform spatial resolution while multiple camera rigs can provide large fields of view with uniform spatial resolution. Similarly different types of features are extracted from the environment including point features, edge/line features and some SLAM approaches exist which do not explicitly extract any features from the environment. As a SLAM system starts, landmarks for SLAM can be initialised in an undelayed manner as in case of a stereo or multiple camera rig, or by using artificial targets at the start. In contrast, the landmarks are initialised with some delay when a single camera is used to perform SLAM without the use of any artificial target because multiple acquisitions from a single camera are required to compute 3D location of the observed features. Different algorithms have been used to perform SLAM including Extended Kalman Filtering, Particle Filtering, biologically inspired techniques like RatSLAM, and others like Local Bundle Adjustment. Similarly, vision based SLAM has been carried out with and without using the wheel odometry information. Each of the above described approaches to solve different issues involved in performing SLAM have their own pros and cons and one approach can be more suitable for a specific application than others. A framework for development of a synthetic dataset is presented which can permit the implementation and hence testing and evaluation of different vision based SLAM techniques. Implementation of Extended Kalman Filtering based SLAM on the developed data set is also presented.},

abstract = {Book overview On March 17 1989, the Civic Tower of Pavia collapsed without apparently any warning sign, killing four people. After an experimental and analytical investigation lasted nine months, the collapse cause was found in a progressive damage dating back many years and due mainly to the heavy dead load put on top of the existing medieval tower when realising a massive bell-tower in granite. Other case histories have been collected as the collapse of the St. Marco bell-tower in Venice in 1902, of the Sancta Maria Magdalena bell-tower in 1992 in Dusseldorf, the damages of the bell-tower of the Monza Cathedral and of the Torrazzo in Cremona. Later on, in 1996 the collapse of the Noto Cathedral showed that similar progressive damages can take place in pillars of churches and cathedrals. The experimental research aimed to show the reliability of this interpretation went on and it is still continuing since 1989 and it is described in the book. After a careful interpretation of the experimental results, also based on experiences from rock mechanics and concrete, the modelling of the phenomenon for massive structures as creep behaviour of masonry was implemented. The book has the scope of helping architects and engineers to deal with the continuous damage of heavy structures and, to understand the signs of the phenomenon while proposing some modelling, but also to give guidelines for the on site investigation, monitoring and repairing of the damaged structures.

The propagation of acoustic signals in submarine media is possible with very low frequency signal carriers only, therefore reduced bandwidth, low transmission rates, thus extending transmission duration and diminishing battery life. Requirements to increase transmission data rates for UWSN have made it attractive to explore the possibilities of higher frequency EM transmissions. Recent experiments show that huge EM signal losses are to be expected in the near field of the transmitting antenna, however experiencing little additional reductions thereafter. The lack of a unified simple analytical model based on Maxwell's equations that can be used as a design tool for these wireless submarine links, validated against published experimental results, is a problem that has been solved in this paper.},

abstract = {Computer vision is challenged by the underwater environment. Poor visibility, geometrical distortions and non-uniform illumination typically make underwater vision less trivial than open air vision. One effect which can be rather strong in this domain is sunlight flicker. Here, submerged objects and the water volume itself are illuminated in a natural random pattern, which is spatially and temporally varying. This phenomenon has been considered mainly as a significant disturbance to vision. We show that the spatiotemporal variations of flicker can actually be beneficial to underwater vision. Specifically, flicker disambiguates stereo correspondence. This disambiguation is very simple, yet it yields accurate results. Under flickering illumination, each object point in the scene has a unique, unambiguous temporal signature. This temporal signature enables us to find dense and accurate correspondence underwater. This process may be enhanced by involving the spatial variability of the flicker field in the solution. The method is demonstrated underwater by in-situ experiments. This method may be useful to a wide range of shallow underwater applications.},

The reason is that waves on the water surface refract light into the water in a spatiotemporally varying manner. The resulting underwater illumination field is known as underwater caustics or flicker. In past studies, flicker has often been considered to be an undesired effect, which degrades the quality of images. In contrast, in this work, we show that flicker can actually be useful for vision in the underwater domain. Specifically, it solves very simply, accurately, and densely the stereo correspondence problem, irrespective of the object's texture. The temporal radiance variations due to flicker are unique to each object point, thus disambiguating the correspondence, with very simple calculations. This process is further enhanced by compounding the spatial variability in the flicker field. The method is demonstrated by underwater in-situ experiments.},

Topological information is taken from the SLAM algorithm, i.e. the three-dimensional approximate position of the landmark with a certain level of uncertainty. Contextual information is obtained by segmenting the image into background and RoIs. Features extracted from points of interest are then computed by using common feature extractors such as SIFT and SURF. This information is used to associate new observations with known landmarks obtained from previous observations.

abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of constructing high quality mosaics of the sea bed. It focuses on the use of long image sequences with time-distant superpositions, such as the ones arising from loop trajectories or zig-zag scanning patterns. An algorithm is presented for the simultaneous creation of mosaics and the estimation of the camera trajectory. The method comprises three major stages. The first stage consists of the sequential estimation of the image motion, using a reduced image motion model. The set of resulting consecutive homographies is cascaded, in order to infer the approximate topology of the camera movement. The topology information is then used to predict the area where there is image overlap resulting from nonconsecutive images. Secondly, a motion refinement is performed, by iteratively executing the following two main steps. (1) Point correspondences are established between non-adjacent pairs of images that present enough overlap. (2) The topology is refined, by searching for the set of homographies that minimizes the overall sum of distances in the point matches. The final stage of the algorithm consists of estimating the set of homographies and a world plane description that best fit the observation data. As the main concern is attaining high registration accuracy, a general parameterization of the homographies with 6 DOF for the pose is used, which is capable of modelling the effects of wave-induced general rotation and translation. The overall method is fully automatic in the sense it does not require human intervention at any of the stages, apart from the beforehand specification of the most adequate motion model for the first stage. We present results obtained from shallow water image sequences acquired by a ROV. The images present some of the common difficulties of underwater mosaicing, such as non-planar sea-bottom, moving objects and severe illumination changes. This sequence also serves to illustrate the robustness and good performance of the presented algorithm},

This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life object recognition application. Both show SURF's strong performance.},

Several approaches try to mimic the lateral-line system by hot-wire or electro-mechanical sensor arrays but none has achieved yet an underwater vehicle using a biomimetic lateralline system for object avoidance, not even in simulation. In this paper we describe construction and properties of low-cost sensors applicable to the task, viz., sensors where a constant current heats thermistors in water ﬂow. With increasing stream velocity, thermal dissipation and thus voltage increases. A glassbead and a bow protect the thermistors. The small diameter of 0.36 mm results in a small time constant and thus allows fast measurements. Sensors are about 1 cm long and consume less than 0.2W so that our small-sized underwater vehicle prototype “Snookie” can carry a whole array of them. We describe the magnitude of velocity changes depending on the distance to an obstacle and show experimentally that a single sensor can already detect underwater objects – so much the better a whole ensemble of them, as in ﬁsh.},

Inspired from content-based image retrieval, an efficient approach is the use of visual vocabularies for measuring similarities between images. In this way, images corresponding to the same scene region can be associated. The state of the art proposals that address this topic suffer from two main drawbacks: (i) they require heavy user intervention, generally involving trial and error tasks for training and parameter tuning and (ii) they are suitable for batch processing only, where all the data is readily available before data processing. We propose a novel method for visual vocabulary navigation and mapping that overcomes these shortcomings. First, the vocabularies are built and updated online, during robot navigation, in order to efficiently represent the visual information present in the scene. Also, the vocabulary building process does not require any user intervention.},

These techniques usually involve the extraction and 3D reconstruction of scene interest points. Nevertheless, in large environments the huge volume of acquired information could pose serious problems to real-time data processing. Moreover, In order to minimize the drift, these techniques use data association to close trajectory loops, decreasing the uncertainties in estimating the position of the robot and increasing the precision of the resulting 3D models. When faced to large amounts of features, the efficiency of data association decreases drastically, affecting the global performance. This paper proposes a framework that highly reduces the number of extracted features with minimum impact on the precision of the 3D scene model. This is achieved by minimizing the representation redundancy by analyzing the geometry of the environment and extracting only those features that are both photometrically and geometrically significant},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in the field of underwater robotics is the opacity of the water medium to radio frequency transmission modes, which precludes the use of a global positioning system (GPS) and high speed radio communication in underwater navigation and mapping applications. One approach to underwater robotics that overcomes this limitation is vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), a framework that enables a robot to localize itself, while simultaneously building a map of an unknown environment. The SLAM algorithm provides a probabilistic map that contains the estimated state of the system, including a map of the environment and the pose of the robot. Because the quality of vision-based navigation varies spatially within the environment the performance of visual SLAM strongly depends on the path and motion that the robot follows. While traditionally treated as two separate problems, SLAM and path planning are indeed interrelated: the performance of SLAM depends significantly on the environment and motion; however, control of the robot motion fully depends on the information from SLAM. Therefore, an integrated SLAM control scheme is needed?one that can direct motion for better localization and mapping, and thereby provide more accurate state information back to the controller. This thesis develops perception-driven control, an integrated SLAM and path planning framework that improves the performance of visual SLAM in an informative and efficient way by jointly considering the reward predicted by a candidate camera measurement, along with its likelihood of success based upon visual saliency. The proposed control architecture identifies highly informative candidate locations for SLAM loop-closure that are also visually distinctive, such that a camera-derived pose-constraint is probable. Results are shown for autonomous underwater hull inspection experiments using the Bluefin Robotics Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV).},

abstract = {1. Ecologically significant evolutionary change, occurring over tens of generations or fewer, is now widely documented in nature. These findings counter the long-standing assumption that ecological and evolutionary processes occur on different time-scales, and thus that the study of ecological processes can safely assume evolutionary stasis. Recognition that substantial evolution occurs on ecological time-scales dissolves this dichotomy and provides new opportunities for integrative approaches to pressing ques-tions in many fields of biology. 2. The goals of this special feature are twofold: to consider the factors that influence evolution on ecological time-scales – phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, sexual selection, and gene flow – and to assess the consequences of such evolution – for population persistence, speciation, community dynamics, and ecosystem function. 3. The role of evolution in ecological processes is expected to be largest for traits that change most quickly and for traits that most strongly influence ecological interactions. Understanding this fine-scale interplay of ecological and evolutionary factors will require a new class of eco-evolutionary dynamic modelling. 4. Contemporary evolution occurs in a wide diversity of ecological contexts, but appears to be especially common in response to anthropogenic changes in selection and population structure. Evolutionary biology may thus offer substantial insight to many conservation issues arising from global change. 5. Recent studies suggest that fluctuating selection and associated periods of contemporary evolution are the norm rather than exception throughout the history of life on earth. The consequences of contemporary evolution for population dynamics and ecological interactions are likely ubiquitous in time and space.},

abstract = {Computer games in general and Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games in particular provide a rich chal- lenge for both human- and coimputer controlled players, often denoted as bots. The player or bot controls a large number of units that have to navigate in partially unknown dynamic worlds to pur- sue a goal. Navigation in such worlds can be complex and require much computational resources. Typically it is solved by using some sort of path planning algorithm, and a lot of research has been conducted to improve the performance of such algorithms in dynamic worlds. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate an alternative approach for RTS bots based on Artificial Potential Fields, an area originating from robotics. In robotics the technique has successfully been used for navigation in dynamic environments, and we show that it is possible to use Artificial Potential Fields for navigation in an RTS game setting without any need of path planning. In the first three papers we define and demonstrate a methodology for creating multi-agent potential field based bots for an RTS game scenario where two tank armies battle each other. The fourth paper addresses incomplete information about the gameworld, referred to as the fog ofwar, and show how Potential Field based bots can handle such environments. The final paper shows how a Potential Field based bot can be evolved to handle a more complex full RTS scenario. It addresses resource gathering, construction of bases, technological development and construction of an army consisting of different types of units. We show that Artificial Potential Fields is a viable option for several RTS game scenarios and that the performance, both in terms of being able to win a game and computational resources used, can match and even surpass those of traditional approaches based on path planning.},

abstract = {More and more on-road vehicles are equipped with cameras each day. This paper presents a novel method for estimating the relative motion of a vehicle from a sequence of images obtained using a single vehicle-mounted camera. Recently, several researchers in robotics and computer vision have studied the performance of motion estimation algorithms under non-holonomic constraints and planarity. The successful algorithms typically use the smallest number of feature correspondences with respect to the motion model. It has been strongly established that such minimal algorithms are efficient and robust to outliers when used in a hypothesize-and-test framework such as random sample consensus (RANSAC). In this paper, we show that the planar 2-point motion estimation can be solved analytically using a single quadratic equation, without the need of iterative techniques such as Newton-Raphson method used in existing work. Non-iterative methods are more efficient and do not suffer from local minima problems. Although 2-point motion estimation generates visually accurate on-road vehicle trajectory, the motion is not precise enough to perform dense 3D reconstruction due to the non-planarity of roads. Thus we use a 2-point relative motion algorithm for the initial images followed by 3-point 2D-to-3D camera pose estimation for the subsequent images. Using this hybrid approach, we generate accurate motion estimates for a plane-sweeping algorithm that produces dense depth maps for obstacle detection applications.},

However, the existing approaches are based on matching to individual training images. This paper presents a method for combining multiple images of a 3D object into a single model representation. This provides for recognition of 3D objects from any viewpoint, the generalization of models to non-rigid changes, and improved robustness through the combination of features acquired under a range of imaging conditions. The decision of whether to cluster a training image into an existing view representation or to treat it as a new view is based on the geometric accuracy of the match to previous model views. A new probabilistic model is developed to reduce the false positive matches that would otherwise arise due to loosened geometric constraints on matching 3D and non-rigid models. A system has been developed based on these approaches that is able to robustly recognize 3D objects in cluttered natural images in sub-second times.},

Our main novel contribution is to use an approximate but smooth base mesh generated from the SFM to predict the view at a bundle of poses around automatically selected reference frames spanning the scene, and then warp the base mesh into highly accurate depth maps based on view-predictive optical flow and a constrained scene flow update. The quality of the resulting depth maps means that a convincing global scene model can be obtained simply by placing them side by side and removing overlapping regions. We show that a cluttered indoor environment can be reconstructed from a live hand-held camera in a few seconds, with all processing performed by current desktop hardware. Real-time monocular dense reconstruction opens up many application areas, and we demonstrate both real-time novel view synthesis and advanced augmented reality where augmentations interact physically with the 3D scene and are correctly clipped by occlusions.},

abstract = {Coral reef benthic communities are mosaics of individual bottom-types that are distinguished by their taxonomic composition and functional roles in the ecosystem. Knowledge of community structure is essential to understanding many reef processes. To develop techniques for identification and mapping of reef bottom-types using remote sensing, we measured 13,100 in situ optical reflectance spectra (400-700 nm, 1-nm intervals) of 12 basic reef bottom-types in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans: fleshy (1) brown, (2) green, and (3) red algae; non-fleshy (4) encrusting calcareous and (5) turf algae; (6) bleached, (7) blue, and (8) brown hermatypic coral; (9) soft/gorgonian coral; (10) seagrass; (11) terrigenous mud; and (12) carbonate sand. Each bottom-type exhibits characteristic spectral reflectance features that are conservative across biogeographic regions. Most notable are the brightness of carbonate sand and local extrema near 570 nm in blue (minimum) and brown (maximum) corals. Classification function analyses for the 12 bottom-types achieve mean accuracies of 83{\%}, 76{\%}, and 71{\%} for full-spectrum data (301-wavelength), 52-wavelength, and 14-wavelength subsets, respectively. The distinguishing spectral features for the 12 bottom-types exist in well-defined, narrow (10-20 nm) wavelength ranges and are ubiquitous throughout the world. We reason that spectral reflectance features arise primarily as a result of spectral absorption processes. Radiative transfer modeling shows that in typically clear coral reef waters, dark substrates such as corals have a depth-of-detection limit on the order of 10-20 m. Our results provide the foundation for design of a sensor with the purpose of assessing the global status of coral reefs.},

abstract = {Distinguishing management effects from the inherent variability in a system is a key consideration in assessing reserve efficacy. Here, we demonstrate how seascape heterogeneity, defined as the spatial configuration and composition of coral reef habitats, can mask our ability to discern reserve effects. We then test the application of a landscape approach, utilizing advances in benthic habitat mapping and GIS techniques, to quantify this heterogeneity and alleviate the confounding influence during reserve assessment. Seascape metrics were quantified at multiple spatial scales using a combination of spatial image analysis and in situ surveys at 87 patch reef sites in Glover's Reef Lagoon, Belize, within and outside a marine reserve enforced since 1998. Patch reef sites were then clustered into classes sharing similar seascape attributes using metrics that correlated significantly to observed variations in both fish and coral communities. When the efficacy of the marine reserve was assessed without including landscape attributes, no reserve effects were detected in the diversity and abundance of fish and coral communities, despite 10 years of management protection. However, grouping sites based on landscape attributes revealed significant reserve effects between site classes. Fish had higher total biomass (1.5x) and commercially important biomass (1.75x) inside the reserve and coral cover was 1.8 times greater inside the reserve, though direction and degree of response varied by seascape class. Our findings show that the application of a landscape classification approach vastly improves our ability to evaluate the efficacy of marine reserves by controlling for confounding effects of seascape heterogeneity and suggests that landscape heterogeneity should be considered in future reserve design.},

abstract = {The disappearance of Acropora palmata from reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) represents a significant loss in the amount of structurally complex habitat available for reef-associated species. The consequences of such a widespread loss of complex structure on ecosystem processes are still unclear. We sought to determine whether the disappearance of complex structure has adversely affected grazing and invertebrate predation rates on a shallow reef in the FKNMS. Surprisingly, we found grazing rates and invertebrate predation rates were lower in the structurally complex A. palmata branches than on the topographically simple degraded reefs. We attribute these results to high densities of aggressively territorial damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, living within A. palmata. Our study suggests the presence of agonistic damselfish can cause the realized spatial patterns of ecosystem processes to deviate from the expected patterns. Reef ecologists must therefore carefully consider the assemblage of associate fish communities when assessing how the mortality of A. palmata has affected coral reef ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {* In light of the continuing biodiversity crisis, the need for high-resolution, broad-scale ecological data is particularly acute. The expansive scale of volunteer data collection programmes provides an opportunity to address this challenge, however, protocols used to collect such data are typically less standardized than those used by professional scientists. Although previous studies have established that different protocols can lead to different results, it remains unclear how relevant these differences are to specific study goals, such as biodiversity assessment. * This study uses both null model and Bayesian occupancy approaches to examine the capacity of a widely used volunteer survey protocol, the roving diver transect, to detect patterns of marine fish diversity. Richness estimates are compared with those obtained using the conventional belt transects favoured in many peer reviewed studies, examining the power of both protocols to detect statistically significant differences between survey sites and quantifying differences in detectability. * Pairwise site comparisons of $\alpha$-diversity (i.e. within site diversity) were consistent between protocols, particularly for species totals. * The roving diver transect protocol detected a substantially larger number of species than the belt transect protocol, due to notably higher detectability, even after controlling for confounding factors. Both protocols detected the same species pool, although the species richness among observations was higher for the belt protocol at certain sites. * The significance of pairwise site $\beta$-diversity (i.e. differentiation between sites) comparisons differed between the protocols and care should be exercised, when using either protocol, when studying variation in species composition. * These results provide vital information for managers and researchers considering the use of volunteer data or protocols for the purpose of biodiversity assessment in aquatic systems, helping to quantify the value of thousands of existing survey records. The larger number of species detected by the volunteer protocol suggests this protocol may be advantageous with regards to the completion of taxonomic lists.},

abstract = {Using trained observers and video images of reef transects from many parts of the Great Barrier Reef, we investigated (1) accuracy of classification of benthos and (2) variability contributed by observers to the precision of estimates of benthic cover obtained from video tapes. In order to estimate accuracy of identification, benthic organisms were identified twice, first in the field and later from video images. These identifications were then compared. The effect of observer error on precision of benthic cover estimates was examined by having 2 observers sample the same video images on 3 separate occasions. These estimates were then compared at the level of different benthic groups (hard coral, soft coral and algae) and for different hierarchical levels of classification of hard corals (life form, family, genus and species). 'Benthic groups' (mean accuracy of 90 +/- 8{\%}) and 'families of hard coral' (91 +/- 7{\%}) were identified most accurately and least variably from video images, although many genera and some distinctive species were also identified reliably. Life forms of hard corals proved to be the least accurate and most variable level of classification, with a mean accuracy rating of 74 +/- 16{\%}. There was little additional variation in estimates of cover when 2 trained observers sampled images, compared with variation in estimates of cover from repeated samples of images by a single observer. At 10{\%} cover, variability in estimates made by a single observer resulted in mean CIs of 7.9 to 12.1{\%}. Inclusion of variation between observers expanded CIs by only +/-0.22{\%}. Furthermore, total observer error was small relative to estimates of cover. For example, at 30{\%} cover, the mean Cl due to both between- and within-observer variability was 27.2 to 32.8{\%}.},

abstract = {Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = {\textgreater}0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92{\%} map accuracy) than BRT (68{\%} map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

A perceptual approach presents a lot of advantages: it is unsupervised, robust and has local filtering properties, that lead to more effective results.

abstract = {This paper investigates the influence of animal-like features (ears of a dragon lizard and comb of a cockatoo) and their pose variations on the quality of emotion expression of the robot head EDDIE. User studies are conducted presenting emotional expressions composed of the six basic emotions (based on Facial Action Coding Units (FACS) action units) in combination with the animal-like features under various inclination angles to human participants in randomized order. The results show that (i) the animal-like features have a significant influence on emotion expression, (ii) the expressed emotions are shifted in affective space dependent on the inclination angles of the animal-like features, (iii) these shifts are not uniform and differ in orientation for each of the expressed emotions, and (iv) for some emotions ground truth is matched better with the animal-like features in addition to FACS action units. The animal-like features, thus, help to improve the emotion expression of EDDIE, which is particularly beneficial because some action units have not been realized well or not realized at all. This study is a successful demonstration how expressive robot heads with rather technical design can benefit from additional expressive features, e.g., animal-like or fictionally designed, which are not based on FACS, in order to improve emotion expression. ¬{\textcopyright} 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates how multi-scale measures of rugosity, slope and aspect can be derived from fine-scale bathymetric reconstructions created from geo-referenced stereo imagery. We generate three-dimensional reconstructions over large spatial scales using data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), manned submersibles and diver-held imaging systems. We propose a new method for calculating rugosity in a Delaunay triangulated surface mesh by projecting areas onto the plane of best fit using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Slope and aspect can be calculated with very little extra effort, and fitting a plane serves to decouple rugosity from slope. We compare the results of the virtual terrain complexity calculations with experimental results using conventional in-situ measurement methods. We show that performing calculations over a digital terrain reconstruction is more flexible, robust and easily repeatable. In addition, the method is non-contact and provides much less environmental impact compared to traditional survey techniques. For diver-based surveys, the time underwater needed to collect rugosity data is significantly reduced and, being a technique based on images, it is possible to use robotic platforms that can operate beyond diver depths. Measurements can be calculated exhaustively at multiple scales for surveys with tens of thousands of images covering thousands of square metres. The technique is demonstrated on data gathered by a diver-rig and an AUV, on small single-transect surveys and on a larger, dense survey that covers over [Formula: see text]. Stereo images provide 3D structure as well as visual appearance, which could potentially feed into automated classification techniques. Our multi-scale rugosity, slope and aspect measures have already been adopted in a number of marine science studies. This paper presents a detailed description of the method and thoroughly validates it against traditional in-situ measurements.},

In this paper, we present a real-time capable framework that recognizes traditional visual human communication signals in order to establish a more intuitive human-machine interaction. Humans rely on the interaction partner's face for identification, which helps them to adapt to the interaction partner and utilize context information. Head gestures (head nodding and head shaking) are a convenient way to show agreement or disagreement. Facial expressions give evidence about the interaction partners' emotional state and hand gestures are a fast way of passing simple commands. The recognition of all interaction queues is performed in parallel, enabled by a shared memory implementation.},

abstract = {A common problem in video surveys in very shallow waters is the presence of strong light fluctuations, due to sun light refraction. Refracted sunlight casts fast moving patterns, which can significantly degrade the quality of the acquired data. Motivated by the growing need to improve the quality of shallow water imagery, we propose a method to remove sunlight patterns in video sequences. The method exploits the fact that video sequences allow several observations of the same area of the sea floor, over time. It is based on computing the image difference between a given reference frame and the temporal median of a registered set of neighboring images. A key observation is that this difference will have two components with separable spectral content. One is related to the illumination field (lower spatial frequencies) and the other to the registration error (higher frequencies). The illumination field, recovered by lowpass filtering, is used to correct the reference image. In addition to removing the sunflickering patterns, an important advantage of the approach is the ability to preserve the sharpness in corrected image, even in the presence of registration inaccuracies. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated in image sets acquired under strong camera motion containing non-rigid benthic structures. The results testify the good performance and generality of the approach.},

abstract = {Our research is motivated by an evident lack of evaluation of recent image matching techniques for applications in underwater vision. This paper is a first step in this direction. This work compares the performance of popular salient keypoint detectors on images degraded by turbidity. We show that, as opposed to over-land, on images acquired in water medium, Hessian-based approaches outperform their Laplacian and Harris counterparts. Fast Hessian, the detector of the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) matching technique, is recognized to be the best method for scale-invariant detection. Conversely, when invariance to scale is not required, a combination of standard Hessian and Harris with sub-pixel accuracy and non-maxima suppression is more accurate. The objective of our work was also to create and distribute a reference set of turbid images, which can be used to evaluate processing, detection, description and matching techniques for underwater applications. We present a collection of 36 images acquired by a specially designed trinocular system under 12 gradually increasing turbidity levels. We also draw attention to image quality assessment method called SSIM, Structural SIMilarity index, which reliably quantifyes degradation of image quality caused by turbidity. As a whole, the major goal of this paper is to provide an updated reference for researchers dealing with keypoint detection in underwater imaging.},

abstract = {Large area photo-mosaics are widely used in many different applications such as optical mapping, panorama creation and autonomous vehicle navigation. When the trajectory of the camera provides an overlap between non-consecutive images (closed-loop trajectory), it is essential to detect such events in order to get globally coherent mosaics. Recent advances in image matching methods allow for registering pairs of images in the absence of prior information on orientation, scale or overlap between images. Owing to this, recent batch mosaicing algorithms attempt to detect non-consecutive overlapping images using exhaustive matching of image pairs. This paper proposes the use of Observation Mutual Information as a criterion to evaluate the benefit of potential matches between pairs of images. This allows for ranking and ordering a list of potential matches in order to make the loop-closing process more efficient. In this paper, the Observation Mutual Information criterion is compared against other strategies and results are presented using underwater imagery.},

abstract = {Detecting changes between images of the same scene taken at different times is of great interest for monitoring and understanding the environment. It is widely used for on-land application but suffers from different constraints. Unfortunately, Change detection algorithms require highly accurate geometric and photometric registration. This requirement has precluded their use in underwater imagery in the past. In this paper, the change detection techniques available nowadays for on-land application were analyzed and a method to automatically detect the changes in sequences of underwater images is proposed. Target application scenarios are habitat restoration sites, or area monitoring after sudden impacts from hurricanes or ship groundings. The method is based on the creation of a 3D terrain model from one image sequence over an area of interest. This model allows for synthesizing textured views that correspond to the same viewpoints of a second image sequence. The generated views are photometrically matched and corrected against the corresponding frames from the second sequence. Standard change detection techniques are then applied to find areas of difference. Additionally, the paper shows that it is possible to detect false positives, resulting from non-rigid objects, by applying the same change detection method to the first sequence exclusively. The developed method was able to correctly find the changes between two challenging sequences of images from a coral reef taken one year apart and acquired with two different cameras.},

abstract = {In this paper, we intend to show the basis of a general legged locomotion controller with the ability to integrate both posture and rhythmic motion controls and shift continuously from one control method to the other according to the walking speed. The rhythmic motion of each leg in the sagittal plane is generated by a single leg controller which controls the swing-to-stance and stance-to-swing phase transitions using respectively leg loading and unloading information. Since rolling motion induced by inverted pendulum motion during the two-legged stance phases results in the transfer of the load between the contralateral legs, leg loading/unloading involves posture information in the frontal plane. As a result of the phase modulations based on leg loading/unloading, rhythmic motion of each leg is achieved and inter-leg coordination (resulting in a gait) emerges, even without explicit coordination amongst the leg controllers, allowing to realize dynamic walking in the low- to medium-speed range. We show that the proposed method has resistance ability against lateral perturbations to some extent, but that an additional ascending coordination mechanism between ipsilateral legs is necessary to withstand perturbations decreasing the rolling motion amplitude. Even without stepping reflex using vestibular information, our control system, relying on phase modulations based on leg loading/unloading and the ascending coordination mechanism between ipsilateral legs, enables low speed dynamic walking on uneven terrain with long cyclic period, which was not realized in our former studies.

abstract = {This paper presents a supervised learning approach to improving the autonomous mobility of wheeled robots through sensing the robot's interaction with terrain ‘underfoot.' Mobility characterization is cast as a hierarchical task, in which pre-immobilization detection is achieved using support vector machines in time to prevent full immobilization, and if a pre-immobilization condition is detected, the associated terrain feature affecting mobility is identified using a Hidden Markov model. These methods are implemented using a hierarchical, layered control scheme developed for the Yeti robot, a 73-kg, four-wheeled robot designed to perform autonomous medium-range missions in polar terrain. The methodology is motivated by the difficultly of visually recognizing terrain features that impact mobility in low contrast terrain. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated using data from a suite of proprioceptive sensors. Real-time implementation shows that Yeti can consistently detect pre-immobilization conditions, stop in time to avoid unrecoverable immobilization, identify the terrain feature presenting the mobility challenge, and execute an escape sequence to retreat from the condition.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a framework for semi-autonomous operation of an under-actuated underwater vehicle. The contributions of this paper are twofold: The first contribution is a visual servoing control scheme that is designed to provide a human operator the capability to steer the vehicle without loosing the target from the vision system's field of view. It is shown that the under-actuated degree of freedom is input-to-state stable (ISS) and a shaping of the user input with stability guarantees is implemented. The resulting control scheme has formally guaranteed stability and convergence properties. The second contribution is an asynchronous Modified Dual Unscented Kalman Filter (MDUKF) for the on-line state and parameter estimation of the vehicle by fusing data from a Laser Vision System (LVS) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The MDUKF has been developed in order to experimentally verify the performance of the proposed visual servoing control scheme. Experimental results of the visual servoing control scheme integrated with the asynchronous MDUKF indicate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed control scheme. Experiments have been carried out on a small under-actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in a test tank.},

Yet observing color in water is important for monitoring and surveillance as well as marine biology studies related to species identification, individual and group behavior, and ecosystem health and activity monitoring. Underwater robots are equipped with motor control for large scale transects but they lack sensors that enable capturing color-accurate underwater images. We present a method for color-accurate imaging in water called perceptual adaptive illumination. This method dynamically mixes the illumination of an object in a distance-dependent way using a controllable, multi-color light source. The color mix compensates correctly for color loss and results in an image whose color composition is equivalent to rendering the object in air. Experiments were conducted with a color palette in the pool and at three different coral reefs sites, and with an underwater robot collecting image data with the new sensor.},

abstract = {Current control systems regulate the behavior of dynamic systems by reacting to noise and unexpected disturbances as they occur. To improve the performance of such control systems, experience from iterative executions can be used to anticipate recurring disturbances and proactively compensate for them. This paper presents an algorithm that exploits data from previous repetitions in order to learn to precisely follow a predefined trajectory. We adapt the feed-forward input signal to the system with the goal of achieving high tracking performance—even under the presence of model errors and other recurring disturbances. The approach is based on a dynamics model that captures the essential features of the system and that explicitly takes system input and state constraints into account. We combine traditional optimal filtering methods with state-of-the-art optimization techniques in order to obtain an effective and computationally efficient learning strategy that updates the feed-forward input signal according to a customizable learning objective. It is possible to define a termination condition that stops an execution early if the deviation from the nominal trajectory exceeds a given bound. This allows for a safe learning that gradually extends the time horizon of the trajectory. We developed a framework for generating arbitrary flight trajectories and for applying the algorithm to highly maneuverable autonomous quadrotor vehicles in the ETH Flying Machine Arena testbed. Experimental results are discussed for selected trajectories and different learning algorithm parameters.},

abstract = {We describe a novel quadrotor Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) system that is designed to use computer vision algorithms within the flight control loop. The main contribution is a MAV system that is able to run both the vision-based flight control and stereo-vision-based obstacle detection parallelly on an embedded computer onboard the MAV. The system design features the integration of a powerful onboard computer and the synchronization of IMU-Vision measurements by hardware timestamping which allows tight integration of IMU measurements into the computer vision pipeline. We evaluate the accuracy of marker-based visual pose estimation for flight control and demonstrate marker-based autonomous flight including obstacle detection using stereo vision. We also show the benefits of our IMU-Vision synchronization for egomotion estimation in additional experiments where we use the synchronized measurements for pose estimation using the 2pt+gravity formulation of the PnP problem.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and development of autonomous attitude stabilization, navigation in unstructured, GPS-denied environments, aggressive landing on inclined surfaces, and aerial gripping using onboard sensors on a low-cost, custom-built quadrotor. The development of a multi-functional micro air vehicle (MAV) that utilizes inexpensive off-the-shelf components presents multiple challenges due to noise and sensor accuracy, and there are control challenges involved with achieving various capabilities beyond navigation. This paper addresses these issues by developing a complete system from the ground up, addressing the attitude stabilization problem using extensive filtering and an attitude estimation filter recently developed in the literature. Navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments is achieved using a visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm that relies on an onboard monocular camera. The system utilizes nested controllers for attitude stabilization, vision-based navigation, and guidance, with the navigation controller implemented using a nonlinear controller based on the sigmoid function. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by maintaining a stable hover even in the presence of wind gusts and when manually hitting and pulling on the quadrotor. Precision landing on inclined surfaces is demonstrated as an example of an aggressive maneuver, and is performed using only onboard sensing. Aerial gripping is accomplished with the addition of a secondary camera, capable of detecting infrared light sources, which is used to estimate the 3D location of an object, while an under-actuated and passively compliant manipulator is designed for effective gripping under uncertainty. The quadrotor is therefore able to autonomously navigate inside and outside, in the presence of disturbances, and perform tasks such as aggressively landing on inclined surfaces and locating and grasping an object, using only inexpensive, onboard sensors.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an approach that scales assignment algorithms to large numbers of robots and tasks. It is especially suitable for dy- namic task allocations since both task locality and sparsity can be effec- tively exploited. We observe that an assignment can be computed through coarsening and partitioning operations on the standard utility matrix via a set of mature partitioning techniques and programs. The algorithm mixes centralized and decentralized approaches dynamically at different scales to produce a fast, robust method that is accurate and scalable, and reduces both the global communication and unnecessary repeated com- putation. An allocation results by operating on each partition: either the steps are repeated recursively to refine the generalized assignment, or each sub-problem may be solved by an existing algorithm. The results suggest that only a minor sacrifice in solution quality is needed for significant gains in efficiency. The algorithm is validated using extensive simulation experiments and the results show advantages over the traditional optimal assignment algorithms.},

The current problem is part of a larger project, which is developing an autonomous MAV, controlled by vision only information. A new algorithm is proposed that uses a stored image of the ground, a snapshot taken of the ground directly under the MAV, as a visual anchor point. The absolute translation of the aircraft and its velocity are then calculated by comparing the subsequent frames with the stored image and fed into the position controller. In order to increase the performance, several issues, such as effects of scale uncertainty on the closed loop stability of the platform are investigated. For controller design and testing purposes, we analytically derive a complete model of a small size helicopter with no stabilizing bar (flybar). The simulation results for 2D and 3D snapshots confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Several approaches try to mimic the lateral-line system by hot-wire or electro-mechanical sensor arrays but none has achieved yet an underwater vehicle using a biomimetic lateral-line system for object avoidance, not even in simulation. In this paper we describe construction and properties of low-cost sensors applicable to the task, viz., sensors where a constant current heats thermistors in water flow. With increasing stream velocity, thermal dissipation and thus voltage increases. A glass-bead and a bow protect the thermistors. The small diameter of 0.36mm results in a small time constant and thus allows fast measurements. Sensors are about 1 cm long and consume less than 0.2W so that our small-sized underwater vehicle prototype {\&}{\#}x201C;Snookie{\&}{\#}x201D; can carry a whole array of them. We describe the magnitude of velocity changes depending on the distance to an obstacle and show experimentally that a single sensor can already detect underwater objects - so much the better a whole ensemble of them, as in fish.},

First, we present a thruster model incorporating the effects of rotational fluid velocity and inertia on thruster response. Second, we report a novel method for experimentally determining nonsinusoidal lift/drag curves. The model parameters are identified using experimental thruster data (force, torque, and fluid velocity). The models are evaluated by comparing experimental performance data with numerical model simulations. The data indicates that thruster models incorporating both reported enhancements provide superior accuracy in both transient and steady-state responses},

abstract = {To improve the maneuverability of underwater vehicles, accurate thrust model is required. However, its modeling is not only difficult but also inaccurate, because it has highly nonlinear dynamics and many parameters which cannot be modeled exactly. Generally, a propeller's steady-state axial thrust is proportional to the signed square of propeller shaft velocity under bollard pull condition. And, it is reported that the velocity of the ambient flow of the thruster affects the thrust force largely. From these facts, we can easily make a reasonable inference that the thrust force may also be affected by the thruster spouting angle with respect to the vehicle moving direction. However, the effect of this non-parallel ambient flow is not well understood in the previous works. Hence, in this paper, a new parameter, what we call incoming angle, is introduced and its effect on thrust force is shown. Incoming angle is defined as the angle between the direction of thrust and that of vehicle velocity. The effect of this angle can be dominant during an underwater vehicle changes its direction, or an omni-directional vehicle carries out its task. The effect cannot be compensated by including the only parallel component of vehicle velocity into previous models. In this paper, based on the three axial flow states classification model, the effect of the incoming angle of ambient flow is analyzed, and critical incoming angle (CIA) is also defined to describe the thrust force states according to incoming angle. In order to characterize the effect of non-parallel ambient flow, the proposed model is evaluated by comparing experimental data with numerical model simulation data, and it accurately covers overall flow conditions within {\&}plusmn;2N force error.},

abstract = {Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV's) are used in a number of applications such as pipeline and offshore structure maintenance by the offshore oil industry, and for mine clearance by the navy. They typically operate in a large range of flow conditions making it difficult to predict the hydrodynamic forces acting on them, and consequently making vehicle control difficult. The aim of this project was to obtain hydrodynamic derivative measurements from sea trials using an underwater vehicle which is a half-scale model of the PAP-104 mine countermeasures UUV. Trials data were collected for a series of manoeuvres which were then reconstructed to give the required vehicle state estimates. This reconstruction was carried out using an extended Kalman filter. Hydrodynamic derivative estimates were then generated by a stepwise regression algorithm, which took the reconstructed vehicle state and measured vehicle forces as input. Traditionally these types of hydrodynamic measurements are made using a Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM). Any later changes to the vehicle configuration may reduce the usefulness of these measurements. Ideally system identification (SI) techniques would provide a more practical alternative, as the UUV need only be driven in a predefined way and the SI techniques applied in order to obtain current hydrodynamic measurements. SI techniques also give measurements based on the overall response of the vehicle and umbilical, which is not the case with PMM measurements.},

The$\backslash$nend result is a model that provides accurate predictions for the joint$\backslash$ntorques of a two-link arm in a form simple enough to be implemented in$\backslash$nalgorithms for precision planning and control.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling the four quadrant dynamic response of thrusters as used for the motion control of ROV and AUV underwater vehicles. The significance is that these vehicles are small in size and respond quickly to commands. Precision in motion control will require further understanding of thruster performance than is currently available. The model includes a four quadrant mapping of the propeller blades lift and drag forces and is coupled with motor and fluid system dynamics. A series of experiments is described for both long and short period triangular, as well as square wave inputs. The model is compared favorably with experimental data for a variety of differing conditions and predicts that force overshoots are observed under conditions of rapid command changes. Use of the model will improve the control of dynamic thrust on these vehicles.},

abstract = {As autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV's) become more pervasive and enter common usage, systems that expand their capabilities, extend their range, and/or permit operation in denied areas become essential. A dock is one method of achieving these goals. An autonomous dock for an AUV provides the capability to greatly increase the duration and extent of AUV operations, provided the dock has a substantially greater energy supply than the AUV. Other docking station applications include the possibility of installation onto a cabled Oceanographic observatory, thus providing unlimited power for battery recharge and continuous data communications. This paper presents the design, development, testing, and results of recent field demonstrations of a compact bottom-mounted docking station for a modified REMUS-100 series AUV. In addition to the dock development, the REMUS vehicle was enhanced with a new, modular endcap to facilitate the installation of modular sensors to the vehicle for the docking program. These sensors include a new digital ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic homing array and a periscope camera for sea-surface observations. The USBL homing array along with DVL velocity and altitude information provided the capability of the AUV to reliably navigate along a preprogrammed glidepath into an entrance nozzle of the dock. A unique challenge of this second generation docking system was the requirement for small size and near-bottom entrance into the dock},

During planned autonomous operations and un-tethered ascents, or if the fiber breaks, the vehicle uses an acoustic communication system to allow engineers and scientists at the surface to monitor its systems and control its operation. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Micro-Modem, programmable for different data rates, bandwidths and carrier frequencies, uses directional transducers on both the ship and the vehicle, operating in the band from 7 to 14 kHz, to provide the communications link. During recent sea trials of Nereus in the Mariana Trench to 10,903 m depth, ten different combinations of rates, bandwidths, and carrier frequencies were tested to establish the performance of each with respect to acoustic range. 5000 bps was possible to 6000 m range, and at 11000 m range, 200 bits per second was reliable.},

abstract = {Rhythmic body motions observed in animal locomotion are known to be controlled by neuronal circuits called central pattern generators (CPGs). It appears that CPGs are energy efficient controllers that cooperate with biomechanical and environmental constraints through sensory feedback. In particular, the CPGs tend to induce rhythmic motion of the body at a natural frequency, i.e., the CPGs are entrained to a mechanical resonance by sensory feedback. The objective of this paper is to uncover the mechanism of entrainment resulting from the dynamic interaction of the CPG and mechanical system. We first develop multiple CPG models for the reciprocal inhibition oscillator (RIO) and examine through numerical experiments whether they can be entrained to a simple pendulum. This comparative study identifies the neuronal properties essential for the entrainment. We then analyze the simplest model that captures the essential dynamics via the method of harmonic balance. It is shown that robust entrainment results from a strong, positive-feedback coupling of a lightly damped mechanical system and the RIO consisting of neurons with the complete adaptation property.},

This paper presents design principles for our modular robots, called Roombots, as future building blocks for furniture that moves and self-reconfigures. The reconfiguration is done using dynamic connection and disconnection of modules and rotations of the degrees of freedom. We are furthermore interested in applying Roombots towards adaptive behaviour, such as online learning of locomotion patterns. To create coordinated and efficient gait patterns, we use a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) approach, which can easily be optimized by any gradient-free optimization algorithm. To provide a hardware framework we present the mechanical design of the Roombots modules and an active connection mechanism based on physical latches. Further we discuss the application of our Roombots modules as pieces of a homogenic or heterogenic mix of building blocks for static structures.},

abstract = {A trustable and accurate ground truth is a key requirement for benchmarking self-localization and mapping algorithms; on the other hand, collection of ground truth is a complex and daunting task, and its validation is a challenging issue. In this paper we propose two techniques for indoor ground truth collection, developed in the framework of the European project Rawseeds , which are mutually independent and also independent on the sensors onboard the robot. These techniques are based, respectively, on a network of fixed cameras, and on a network of fixed laser scanners. We show how these systems are implemented and deployed, and, most importantly, we evaluate their performance; moreover, we investigate the possible fusion of their outputs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of creating an objective benchmark for evaluating SLAM approaches.We propose a framework for analyzing the results of a SLAM approach based on a metric for measuring the error of the corrected trajectory. This metric uses only relative relations between poses and does not rely on a global reference frame. This overcomes serious shortcomings of approaches using a global reference frame to compute the error. Our method furthermore allows us to compare SLAM approaches that use different estimation techniques or different sensor modalities since all computations are made based on the corrected trajectory of the robot. We provide sets of relative relations needed to compute our metric for an extensive set of datasets frequently used in the robotics community. The relations have been obtained by manually matching laser-range observations to avoid the errors caused by matching algorithms. Our benchmark framework allows the user to easily analyze and objectively compare different SLAM approaches.},

@article{Ramisa2009,
abstract = {This paper presents a vision-based approach for mobile robot localization. The model of the environment is topological. The new approach characterizes a place using a signature. This signature consists of a constellation of de- scriptors computed over different types of local affine co- variant regions extracted from an omnidirectional image ac- quired rotating a standard camera with a pan-tilt unit. This type of representation permits a reliable and distinctive envi- ronment modelling. Our objectives were to validate the pro- posed method in indoor environments and, also, to find out if the combination of complementary local feature region de- tectors improves the localization versus using a single region detector.Our experimental results show that if falsematches are effectively rejected, the combination of different covari- ant affine region detectors increases notably the performance of the approach by combining the different strengths of the individual detectors. In order to reduce the localization time, two strategies are evaluated: re-ranking themap nodes using a global similarity measure and using standard perspective view field of 45°.$\backslash$nIn order to systematically test topological localization methods, another contribution proposed in this work is a novel method to see the degradation in localization perfor- mance as the robot moves away from the point where the original signature was acquired. This allows to know the ro- bustness of the proposed signature. In order for this to be effective, it must be done in several, variated, environments that test all the possible situations in which the robot may have to perform localization.},

@article{Giguere2009,
abstract = {In this paper we are interested in autonomous vehicles that can automatically develop terrain classifiers without human interaction or feedback. A key issue is the clustering of time-series data collected by the sensors of a ground-based vehicle moving over several terrain surfaces (e.g. concrete or soil). In this context, we present a novel off-line windowless clustering algorithm that exploits time-dependency between samples. In terrain coverage, sets of sensory measurements are returned that are spatially, and hence temporally, correlated. Our algorithm works by finding a set of parameter values for a user-specified classifier that minimize a cost function. This cost function is related to the change in classifier probability estimates over time. The main advantage over other existing methods is its ability to cluster data for fast-switching systems that either have high process or observation noise, or complex distributions that cannot be properly characterized within the time interval that the system stays in a single state. The algorithm was evaluated using three different classifiers (linear separator, mixture of Gaussians and k-Nearest Neighbor), over both synthetic data sets and two different mobile robotic platforms, with success. Comparisons are provided against a window-based algorithm and against a hidden Markov model trained with Expectation- Maximization, with positive results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {This paper handles the problem of collision avoidance in a multi-robot environment. To solve this problem, the motion processes of the mobile robots are modelled in space-time. Since the robots are autonomous and communication is non-deterministic, there is temporal uncertainty in addition to spatial uncertainty. The paper presents a method to model both uncertainty components in a homogeneous way. It is shown, that it is not sufficient to guarantee a spatial security distance between the robots. Distances in space-time and space-time vectors must be considered. The main result of this paper is a straightforward and efficient solution to the problem of collision avoidance between up to three mobile robots by applying a space-time displacement vector. The solution is based on space-time, which is a helpful view onto our world in relativity theory and quantum physics. Space-time methods are also very valuable in Robotics, especially for problems in dynamic environments and for motion coordination of mobile robots. Practical experiments with up to two robots, and simulations of up to three robots have been performed and are reported.},

@article{Buchli2008,
abstract = {In this contribution we present experiments of an adaptive locomotion controller on a compliant quadruped robot. The adaptive controller consists of adaptive frequency oscillators in different configurations and produces dynamic gaits such as bounding and jumping. We show two main results: (1) The adaptive controller is able to track the resonant frequency of the robot which is a function of different body parameters (2) controllers based on dynamical systems as we present are able to “recognize” mechanically intrinsic modes of locomotion, adapt to them and enforce them. More specifically the main results are supported by several experiments, showing first that the adaptive controller is constantly tracking body properties and readjusting to them. Second, that important gait parameters are dependent on the geometry and movement of the robot and the controller can account for that. Third, that local control is sufficient and the adaptive controller can adapt to the different mechanical modes. And finally, that key properties of the gaits are not only depending on properties of the body but also the actual mode of movement that the body is operating in. We show that even if we specify the gait pattern on the level of the CPG the chosen gait pattern does not necessarily correspond to the CPG's pattern. Furthermore, we present the analytical treatment of adaptive frequency oscillators in closed feedback loops, and compare the results to the data from the robot experiments.},

abstract = {Recent recordings from spinal neurons in hatchling frog tadpoles allow their type-specific properties to be defined. Seven main types of neuron involved in the control of swimming have been characterized. To investigate the significance of type-specific properties, we build models of each neuron type and assemble them into a network using known connectivity between: sensory neurons, sensory pathway interneurons, central pattern generator (CPG) interneurons and motoneurons. A single stimulus to a sensory neuron initiates swimming where modelled neuronal and network activity parallels physiological activity. Substitution of firing properties between neuron types shows that those of excitatory CPG interneurons are critical for stable swimming. We suggest that type-specific neuronal properties can reflect the requirements for involvement in one particular network response (like swimming), but may also reflect the need to participate in more than one response (like swimming and slower struggling).},

Likewise biological central pattern generators in spinal cord, the CPG layer plays a role in generating torque patterns for realizing periodic motions. On the contrary, the higher brain model, i.e. the Dynamical memory layer is a time-series pattern discriminator implemented by a recurrent neural networks (RNN). By associating timeseries of the system states with optimized CPG parameters, the RNN can predictively modulate the generating torque patterns by recalling well-suited CPG parameters according to the sensorimotor time-series.},

In the research on bio-mechanical engineering, robotics and neurophysiology, the mechanism of human bipedal walking is of major interest. It can serve as a basis for developing several applications such as computer animation and humanoid robots. Nevertheless, because of the complexity of human's neuronal system that interacts with the body dynamics making the walking movements, much is left unknown about the control mechanism of locomotion, and researchers were looking for the optimal model of the neuronal system by extensive efforts of trial and error. In this work, genetic programming is utilized to induce the model of the neural system automatically and its effectives are shown by simulating a human bipedal gait with the obtained model. The experimental results show some promising evidence for evolutionary generation of the human-like bipedal locomotion.},

Introduction The main goal of our research team is to design neural architectures for the control of autonomous mobile robots. Although we use a robot born in the engineer field, we have chosen to take inspiration from neurobiology to design its control system for 2 main reasons: ffl first, it could give us interesting, robust, and ready-made solutions to design control architecture. ffl second, biologists are unfortunately often constrained to study only subparts of the brain due to its complexity.

We briefly explain the design features of the module units. We then present simulation results of the artificial co-evolution of body structures and neural controllers for locomotion. The neural controllers are inspired from the central pattern generators underlying locomotion in vertebrate animals. They are composed of multiple neural oscillators which are connected together by a specific type of coupling called synaptic spreading. The co-evolution of body and controller leads to interesting robots capable of efficient swimming. Interesting features of the neural controllers include the possibility to modulate the speed of locomotion by varying simple input signals, the robustness against perturbations, and the distributed nature of the controllers which makes them well suited for modular robotics.},

This calls for the development of alternative training algorithms such as evolutionary search. However, training by evolutionary search often requires long computation time. In this chapter, we investigate the possibilities of reducing the time taken by combining the efforts of local search and evolutionary search. There are a number of attempts to combine these search strategies, but not all of them are successful. This chapter provides a critical review of these attempts. Moreover, different approaches to combining evolutionary search and local search are compared. Experimental results indicate that while the Baldwinian and the two-phase approaches are inefficient in improving the evolution process for difficult problems, the Lamarckian approach is able to speed up the training process and to improve the solution quality. In this chapter, the strength and weakness of these approaches are illustrated, and the factors affecting their efficiency and applicability are discussed.},

abstract = {In this contribution we use a model of adaptive frequency oscillators to build adaptive Central Pattern Gen- erators (CPG). We use a network of adaptive coupled Hopf oscillators to dynamically learn any periodic signal. The signal is then encoded as a stable limit cycle in the network. The interest of this approach is that the learning is not an external optimization process but is embedded in the dynamics of the network. The learning is successful even when the teaching signal is noisy, and the encoded trajectory is stable against perturbations. Furthermore, the learned trajectory can easily be modulated in frequency or amplitude in a smooth way.},

@article{Cohen1999,
abstract = {Rhythmic movements in biological systems are produced in part by central circuits called central pattern generators (CPGs). For example, locomotion in vertebrates derives from the spinal CPG with activity initiated by the brain and controlled by sensory feedback. Sensory feedback is traditionally viewed as controlling CPGs cycle by cycle, with the brain commanding movements on a top down basis. We present an alternative view which in sensory feedback alters the properties of the CPG on a fast as well as a slow time scale. The CPG, in turn, provides feedforward filtering of the sensory feedback. This bidirectional interaction is widespread across animals, suggesting it is a common feature of motor systems, and, therefore, might offer a new way to view sensorimotor interactions in all systems including robotic systems. Bidirectional interactions are also apparent between the cerebral cortex and the CPG. The motor cortex doesn't simply command muscle contractions, but rather operates with the CPG to produce adaptively structured movements. To facilitate these adaptive interactions, the motor cortex receives feedback from the CPG that creates a temporal activity pattern mirroring the spinal motor output during locomotion. Thus, the activity of the motor cortical cells is shaped by the spinal pattern generator as they drive motor commands. These common features of CPG structure and function are suggested as offering a new perspective for building robotic systems. CPGs offer a potential for adaptive control, especially when combined with the principles of sensorimotor integration described here.},

abstract = {Dynamical systems have been increasingly studied in the last decade for designing locomotion controllers. They offer several advan-tages over previous solutions like synchronization, smooth transitions under parameter variation, and robustness. In this paper, we present an adaptive locomotion controller for four-legged robots. The controller is composed of a set of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems. Using our controller the robot is capable of adapting its locomotion to the phys-ical properties of the robot, in particular its resonant frequency. Our approach aims at developing an on-line learning system that attempts to minimize the energy necessary for the gait. We have implemented the model both in a simulated physical environment (Webots) and on a Sony Aibo robot. We present a series of experiments which demonstrate how the controller can tune its frequency to the resonant frequency of the robot, and modify it when the weight of the robot is changed.},

Toward a comprehensive understanding of the nature of such ecologically balanced legged locomotion, in this paper, we propose a novel method to achieve a form of bounding gait for a quadruped robot by using a minimalistic approach. Although this method uses a simple sinusoidal position con- trol with no global sensory feedback, it is shown that the rapid bounding is possible in a relatively robust manner by properly exploiting the intrinsic dynamics and the interaction with the environment. The behavioral analyses with the robot experiments show that this relatively complicated dynamic locomotion is achieved even with a simple controller mainly because of a self-stabilization mechanism. Moreover, by ex- ploiting this mechanism of self-stabilization, we propose a unique approach to control the forward velocity of the locomotion.},

abstract = {A semi-reduced, minimally restrained lamprey preparation was used to investigate the impact of movement and movement-related feedback during D-glutamate-induced locomotion. The preparation consisted of the trunk alone with the spinal cord exposed to the bathing solution. Two conditions were compared using electromyography or nerve recording: (i) muscle and spinal cord, (ii) spinal cord alone supported by the notochord. Compared with the isolated spinal cord, movement in the presence of muscle consistently and significantly increased the frequency of the motor output and reduced the phase delay among the segments. In moving preparations, coupling among the segments was reduced by two staggered hemisections to permit the strength and direction of intersegmental coupling to be estimated. The estimates revealed that movement increased the total intersegmental coupling strength and increased the proportion of the coupling that was descending over those of the isolated spinal cord.The effects on the phase and frequency of bursting can be explained in the light of the excitation evoked by bending that we have reported previously. Thus, we demonstrate that movement and movement-related feedback that arise from spinally induced motor patterns can alter the form of the movement and the functional coupling strength among the segments of the lamprey spinal cord.},

abstract = {This paper describes the staged evolution of a complex motor pattern generator (CPG) for the control of the leg movements of a six-legged walking robot. The CPG is composed of a network of neurons. In contrast to the main stream work in neural networks, the interconnection weights are altered by a Genetic Algo-rithm (GA), rather than a learning algorithm. Staged evolution is used to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm, thus obtaining rapid evolution of behavior toward a goal set. First, an oscillator for the individual leg movements is evolved. Then, a network of these oscillators is evolved to coordinate the movements of the different legs. In this way, the designer specifies "islands of fitness" on the way to the final goal, rather than using a single fitness function or determining the ex-plicit solution to the control problem. By introducing a staged set of manageable challenges, the algorithm's performance is improved. These techniques may be applicable to other complex or ill-posed control prob-lems in robot control. The system itself determined how to evolve from one island to the next through the GA.},

A four-neuron, mutual inhibitory network forms the basic coordinating pattern for locomotion. This network then inhibits an eight-neuron network used to drive patterned movement. We show that we can get predictable control of important relationships such as the phase of the hip and the knee by adjusting tonic parameters. We demonstrate the basic concept both in a simulation that is used to drive a trotting bipedal robot as well as an aVLSI CPG chip that generates spiking burst patterns. Our results indicate that an inhibitory framework can generate simple, understandable and flexible networks for legged robot control that can be implemented in custom VLSI circuits.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a neuromorphic analog CMOS controller for interlimb coordination in quadruped locomotion. Animal locomotion, such as walking, running, swimming, and flying, is based on periodic rhythmic movements. These rhythmic movements are driven by the biological neural network, called the central pattern generator (CPG). In recent years, many researchers have applied CPG to locomotion controllers in robotics. However, most of these have been developed with digital processors and, thus, have several problems, such as high power consumption. In order to overcome such problems, a CPG controller with analog CMOS circuit is proposed. Since the CMOS transistors in the circuit operate in their subthreshold region and under low supply voltage, the controller can reduce power consumption. Moreover, low-cost production and miniaturization of controllers are expected. We have shown through computer simulation, such circuit has the capability to generate several periodic rhythmic patterns and transitions between their patterns promptly.},

In order to fully realize this potential, however, the concept of autopoiesis and its many consequences require significant further theoretical and empirical development. A crucial step in this direction is the formulation and analysis of models of autopoietic systems. This article sketches the beginnings of such a project by examining a glider from Conway's game of life in autopoietic terms. Such analyses can clarify some of the key ideas underlying autopoiesis and draw attention to some of the central open issues.

When coupled, the self-sustained oscillations of individual free oscillators are replaced by a collective network dynamics. Here, dynamical features of such a network, consisting of three electronic implementations of the Hindmarsh-Rose mathematical model of bursting neurons, are compared to those of a biological neural motor system, specifically the pyloric CPG of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system. We demonstrate that the network of electronic neurons exhibits realistic synchronized bursting behavior comparable to the biological system. Dynamical properties were analyzed by injecting sinusoidal currents into one of the oscillators. The temporal bursting structure of the electronic neurons in response to periodic stimulation is shown to bear a remarkable resemblance to that observed in the corresponding biological network. These findings provide strong evidence that coupled nonlinear oscillators realistically reproduce the network dynamics experimentally observed in assemblies of several neurons.},

Training of the controller is accomplished not with a mathematical model, but with simple rules based on a heuristic knowledge of the quadruped mechanics. The result is a controller that produces better velocity and height tracking characteristics than a Raibert-based controller and is robust to modeling errors. Additionally, by making use of the natural dynamics of the system, gait characteristics comparable to biological quadrupeds result. The status of a legged machine being constructed for demonstration of the control approach and further study of the characteristics of galloping is also presented.},

We describe the Crystalline robots, which consist of modules that can aggregate together to form distributed robot systems and are actuated by expanding and contracting each unit. This actuation mechanism permits automated shape metamorphosis. We also describe an algorithm that uses this actuation mechanism for self-repair.},

abstract = {The locomotor system of slowly walking insects is well suited for coping with highly irregular terrain and therefore might represent a paragon for an artificial six-legged walking machine. Our investigations of the stick insect Carausius morosus indicate that these animals gain their adaptivity and flexibility mainly from the extremely decentralized organization of the control system that generates the leg movements. Neither the movement of a single leg nor the coordination of all six legs (i.e., the gait) appears to be centrally pre-programmed. Thus, instead of using a single, central controller with global knowledge, each leg appears to possess its own controller with only procedural knowledge for the generation of the leg's movement. This is possible because exploiting the physical properties avoids the need for complete information on the geometry of the system that would be a prerequisite for explicitly solving the problems. Hence, production of the gait is an emergent property of the whole system, in which each of the six single-leg controllers obeys a few simple and local rules in processing state-dependent information about its neighbors.},

In contrast to conservative ship-dependent charging processes on the surface, the Subsea Monitoring via Intelligent Swarms (SMIS) consortium uses a seabed station (SBS) as a power supply for AUVs. This paper describes the fully automated secure landing procedure of the SBS followed by a ground mooring maneuver on sandy sediments or soft clays. The unmanned seabed station is equipped with various sensors for status detection and environmental observation. In order to control the freefall and grounding without endangering the valuable components, an innovative procedure was implemented. Once landed, the nearly buoyancyneutral station is moored using down-scaled suctions buckets that are normally used in immobile offshore oil rig foundations. Laboratory full-scale experiments in modified test tanks for different length-to-diameter ratios endorse the design process. The feasibility of landing, mooring and ascending techniques was proven in field-tests in the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are often tasked to explore unseen environments, aiming to acquire and understand large amounts of visual image data and other sensory information. In such scenarios, remote sensing data may be available a priori, and can help to build a semantic model of the environment and plan future autonomous missions. In this paper, we introduce two multimodal learning algorithms to model the relationship between visual images taken by an autonomous underwater vehicle during a survey and remotely sensed acoustic bathymetry (ocean depth) data that is available prior to the survey. We present a multi-layer architecture to capture the joint distribution between the bathymetry and visual modalities. We then propose an extension based on gated feature learning models, which allows the model to cluster the input data in an unsupervised fashion and predict visual image features using just the ocean depth information. Our experiments demonstrate that multimodal learning improves semantic classification accuracy regardless of which modalities are available at classification time, allows for unsupervised clustering of either or both modalities, and can facilitate mission planning by enabling class-based or image-based queries.},

abstract = {We describe an automated computer algorithm for the classification of coral reef benthic organisms and substrates sampled using a typical photographic quadrat survey. The technique compares subsections of a quadrat sample image (blocks) to a library of identified species blocks and computes a distance or probability of identification in a multidimensional hypervolume of discrimination metrics. The discrimination metrics include texture (calculated from a radial sampling of a two-dimensional discrete cosine transform) and three channels of a normalized color space. A standard multivariate classification technique based on the Mahalanobis distance was unsuccessful in discriminating substrata because of the large morphological variation inherent in reef organisms. An alternative classification scheme based on an exhaustive search through an organism reference library yielded classification maps comparable to those obtained by manual analysis.},

abstract = {IEEE Healthy coral reefs play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity in tropical marine ecosystems. Remote imaging techniques have facilitated the scientific investigations of these intricate ecosystems, particularly at depths beyond 10 m where SCUBA diving techniques are not time or cost efficient. With millions of digital images of the seafloor collected using remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), manual annotation of these data by marine experts is a tedious, repetitive, and time-consuming task. It takes 10 {\&} {\#}x2013;30 {\&} {\#}x00A0;min for a marine expert to meticulously annotate a single image. Automated technology to monitor the health of the oceans would allow for transformational ecological outcomes by standardizing methods to detect and identify species. This paper aims to automate the analysis of large available AUV imagery by developing advanced deep learning tools for rapid and large-scale automatic annotation of marine coral species. Such an automated technology would greatly benefit marine ecological studies in terms of cost, speed, and accuracy. To this end, we propose a deep learning based classification method for coral reefs and report the application of the proposed technique to the automatic annotation of unlabeled mosaics of the coral reef in the Abrolhos Islands, W.A., Australia. Our proposed method automatically quantified the coral coverage in this region and detected a decreasing trend in coral population, which is in line with conclusions drawn by marine ecologists.},

abstract = {This study proposes a fully automated and objective technique to map marine landscapes in submarine canyons. The method is suitable for broad and regional scale mapping derived from sonar data using multivariate statistical analysis. The method is divided into two main parts: the terrain analysis and the multivariate statistical analysis. The first part aims to optimise the sonar data and comprises three steps 1) data resampling, 2) determination of length scale, and 3) multiple scale analysis. The second part covers the actual marine landscape classification and consists of 1) principal component analysis (PCA), 2) K-means clustering, and 3) cluster determination. In addition, a confidence map is presented based on cluster membership derived from cluster distance in attribute space.The technique was applied in the Lisbon-Set{\'{u}}bal and Cascais Canyons offshore Portugal. The area was classified into 6 marine landscapes that represent the geomorphological features present in submarine canyons. The main findings from the study are 1) the transferability of a tool from geomorphometric analysis - Estimation of Scale Parameter (ESP) - to detect the length scale of potential patterns in bathymetric grids; 2) multiple scale terrain analysis allows an appropriate discrimination of local and broad scale geomorphic features in marine landscape mapping; 3) the method not only delineates geomorphic seafloor features but also points out properties that might influence biodiversity in a complex terrain.},

Due to their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions, seagrasses are habitually used in monitoring programmes as biological indicators to assess the ecological status of coastal environments. In this paper we used a non-destructive photo mosaicing technology to quantify seagrass distribution and abundance, and explore benefits of micro-cartographic analysis. Furthermore, the use of photogrammetric tools enhanced the method, which proved to be efficient due to its use of low-cost instruments and its simplicity of implementation. This paper describes the steps required to use this method in meadows of Posidonia oceanica, including: i) camera calibration procedures, ii) programming of video survey, iii) criteria to perform sampling activities, iv) data processing and micro-georeferenced maps restitution, and v) possible study applications.},

abstract = {The need for sound baseline information about community structure and composition against which changes can be detected and quantified is a well-recognised priority in Antarctica. Here, the collection of such data is challenging, especially at sea, where long-term monitoring is usually logistically feasible only in the proximity of permanent research stations. In recent years, underwater photogrammetry has emerged as a non-destructive and low-cost method for high-resolution topographic reconstruction. We decided to apply this technique to videos, recorded during standard SCUBA surveys of Antarctic benthos in Tethys Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) in 2006 and 2015 and originally not meant for photogrammetry. Our aim was to assess the validity and utility of the photogrammetric method to describe benthic communities from the perspective of long-term monitoring. For this purpose, two of the transects surveyed in 2015 were revisited in 2017. Videos were processed with photogrammetric procedures to obtain 3D models of the seafloor and inhabiting organisms. Overall, a total of six 20 m-long transects, corresponding to a total area of {\~{}} 200 m2 of seafloor were analysed. Accuracy of the resulting models, expressed in terms of Length Measurement Error (LME), was 1.9 mm on average. The 2017 transects showed marked differences in some species, such as a 25–49{\%} increase in the number of sea urchins Sterechinus neumayeri (Meissner, 1900) and the complete disappearance of some sponges Mycale (Oxymycale) acerata Kirkpatrick, 1907. Our analyses confirm the efficacy of photogrammetry for monitoring programmes, including their value for the re-analysis of legacy video footage.},

Satellites provide wide-range, low- resolution measurements at a low sample rate. Therefore a gap exists in oceano- graphic observation capability for medium-range, high-resolution measurements at a high sample rate. An Unmanned Aeronautical Vehicle (UAV) could bridge this gap.$\backslash$nThis research has provided a mission-ready autopilot and ground station for future oceanographic application by the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. A sea landing is the only available option, which carries a low probability of UAV reuse and therefore requires a low-cost system. This and other application- specific requirements led to the development of all autopilot and ground station software. This research provided novel contributions of pseudo-derivative feedback controllers for flight control, the generation of optimised matrix calculations for high-frequency aircraft state estimates on a low-powered processor and the use of a finite impulse response filter for reduced aliasing of transmitted flight data.$\backslash$nA novel in-flight method for autonomously optimising controller response has been developed and successfully demonstrated in realistic simulation and practical flight tests of a commercial model aircraft. This method does not require an experienced operator or known aircraft dynamics and provides a quantitative measurement of optimality. Two novel path tracking algorithms have been presented. The first controls the derivative of heading rate to command an achievable trajectory. The second con- trols the aircraft's closing speed on the path by adjusting bank angle. The latter algorithm achieved a robust tracking performance under simulated high wind con- ditions and practical flight tests and is suitable for oceanographic UAV operation.},

abstract = {Our understanding of Earth surface processes is rapidly advancing as new remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR and close-range digital photogrammetry become more accessible and affordable. A very-high spatial resolution digital terrain model (DTM) and orthophoto mosaic (mm scale) were produced using close-range digital photogrammetry based on 'Structure-from-Motion' (SfM) algorithms for a 250. m transect along a shallow coral reef flat on Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef. The precise terrain data were used to characterise surface roughness, a critical factor affecting ecological and physical processes on the reef. Three roughness parameters, namely the root mean square height, tortuosity (or rugosity) and fractal dimension, were derived and compared in order to asses which one better characterises reef flat roughness. The typical relief across the shallow reef flat was 0.1. m with a maximum value of 0.42. m. Coral reef terrain roughness, as characterised by the three chosen parameters, generally increased towards the middle of the transect where live coral covers most of the reef flat and decreases towards the edges of the transect. The fractal dimension (values ranging from 2.2 to 2.59) best characterised reef roughness, as evidenced by a closer agreement with the distribution of known coral benthic substrates. This is the first study quantifying scale-independent roughness of a coral reef at benthic and biotope/patch levels (cm-m). The readily available and cost-effective methods presented are highly appropriate for data collection, processing and analysis to generate very-high spatial resolution DTMs and orthophoto mosaics of shallow and energetic coral reefs.},

abstract = {Coral reef populations of a variety of fish and invertebrate species are replenished by individuals that use inshore coastal habitats as temporary juvenile habitats. These habitats vary greatly in their architecture, and different characteristics of structure could play a role in their selection and utilization by resident fauna. To solely investigate the role of structural complexity in microhabitat selection, in situ habitat preference of 48 individuals of the early juvenile stage of a common reef fish (Haemulon flavolineatum) was studied for 4 structurally very different lagoonal microhabitats (i.e. mangrove, seagrass, rubble, coral), using a multiple-choice experiment in field enclosures. This fish species was selected as it utilizes these habitats during different parts of its life cycle. The structural complexity of each microhabitat was changed in each replicate experiment and assessed on the basis of 7 commonly used measures of structure using digitized photographs. We tested the hypothesis that in isolation of other factors, fish prefer the structurally most complex microhabitat that is available, independent of habitat type. However, fish always preferred seagrass and coral microhabitats even when offered at low complexity, and this choice was rather consistent over a 24 h time period. Structural characteristics appeared to be marginally important for the seagrass microhabitat only. Therefore, the differential preference for distinct lagoonal microhabitats does not appear to be driven by measures of structural complexity that are known to be important at the level of individual habitat types. In this light, continuing loss of coral and seagrass habitats in lagoonal environments due to anthropogenic effects is alarming as it affects preferential habitat of certain stages of the life cycle of fishes.},

abstract = {In the past decade, significant efforts have been made to describe fish-habitat associations. However, most studies have oversimplified actual connections between fish assemblages and their habitats by using univariate correlations. The purpose of this study was to identify the features of habitat forming corals that facilitate and influences assemblages of associated species such as fishes. For this we developed three-dimensional models of colonies of Acropora cervicornis to estimate geometry (length and height), structural complexity (i.e., volume, density of branches, etc.) and biological features of the colonies (i.e., live coral tissue, algae). We then correlated these colony characteristics with the associated fish assemblage using multivariate analyses. We found that geometry and complexity were better predictors of the structure of fish community, compared to other variables such as percentage of live coral tissue or algae. Combined, the geometry of each colony explained 40{\%} of the variability of the fish assemblage structure associated with this coral species; 61{\%} of the abundance and 69{\%} of fish richness, respectively. Our study shows that three-dimensional reconstructions of discrete colonies of Acropora cervicornis provides a useful description of the colonial structural complexity and may explain a great deal of the variance in the structure of the associated coral reef fish community. This demonstration of the strongly trait-dependent ecosystem role of this threatened species has important implications for restoration and conservation efforts.},
